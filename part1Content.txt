Principals (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal. (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 684 ; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 655, §17b, 65 Stat. 717 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §550 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §332, 35 Stat. 1152 ). Section 2(a) comprises section 550 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change except in minor matters of phraseology. Section 2(b) is added to permit the deletion from many sections throughout the revision of such phrases as "causes or procures". The section as revised makes clear the legislative intent to punish as a principal not only one who directly commits an offense and one who "aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures" another to commit an offense, but also anyone who causes the doing of an act which if done by him directly would render him guilty of an offense against the United States. It removes all doubt that one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal enterprise but causes the commission of an indispensable element of the offense by an innocent agent or instrumentality, is guilty as a principal even though he intentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the completed offense. This accords with the following decisions: Rothenburg v. United States , 1918, 38 S. Ct. 18, 245 U.S. 480, 62 L. Ed. 414, and United States v. Hodorowicz , C. C. A.

Act Oct. 31, 1951, inserted "willfully" before "causes", and "or another" after "him", and substituted "is punishable as a principal" for "is also a principal and punishable as such". §3. Accessory after the fact Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory after the fact. Except as otherwise expressly provided by any Act of Congress, an accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than one-half the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the principal, or both; or if the principal is punishable by life imprisonment or death, the accessory shall be imprisoned not more than 15 years.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §551 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §333, 35 Stat. 1152 ). The first paragraph is new. It is based upon authority of Skelly v. United States (C. C. A. Okl. 1935, 76 F. 2d 483, certiorari denied, 1935, 55 S. Ct. 914, 295 U.S. 757, 79 L. Ed. 1699), where the court defined an accessory after the fact as— one who knowing a felony to have been committed by another, receives, relieves, comforts, or assists the felon in order to hinder the felon's apprehension, trial, or punishment— and cited Jones' Blackstone, books 3 and 4, page 2204; U.S. v. Hartwell (Fed. Cas. No. 15,318); Albritton v. State (32 Fla. 358, 13 So. 955); State v. Davis (14 R. I. 281); Schleeter v. Commonwealth (218 Ky. 72, 290 S. W. 1075). (See also State v. Potter , 1942, 221 N. C. 153, 19 S. E. 2d 257; Hunter v. State , 1935, 128 Tex. Cr. R. 191, 79 S. W. 2d 855; State v. Wells , 1940, 195 La. 754, 197 So. 419.) The second paragraph is from section 551 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. Here only slight changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322, §330016(2)(A), inserted "(notwithstanding section 3571)" before "fined not more than one-half" in second par. Pub. L. 103–322, §330011(h), amended directory language of Pub.

L. 99–646 inserted "life imprisonment or" in second par. Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Effective Date of 1994 Amendment Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330011(h), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2145 , provided that the amendment made by that section is effective as of Nov. 29, 1990. §4. Misprision of felony Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 684 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C. 1940 ed., §251 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §146, 35 Stat. 1114 ). Changes in phraseology only. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $500". §5. United States defined The term "United States", as used in this title in a territorial sense, includes all places and waters, continental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, except the Canal Zone. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§39, 133, 346, 381, 502, and 632, and section 40 of title 50 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense ( June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title XIII, §1, 40 Stat. 231 ). Section consolidates the first sentence of section 39, all of sections 133, 346, and 632, and the second sentences, respectively, of sections 381 and 502, all of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 40 of title 50 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense, with minor changes in phraseology. All of these sections and parts of sections were derived from section 1 of title XIII of said act of June 15, 1917. Said section 40 of title 50 , U.S.C., War and National Defense, has also been retained in that title, as it still relates to some sections therein which were not transferred to this title. The remainder of said section 39 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was derived from sections 2, 3, and 4 of title XIII of the act of June 15, 1917, relating to jurisdiction and other matters, is almost entirely obsolete. The provisions still in force are incorporated in section 3241 of this title . The remaining provisions of said sections 381 and 502 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were derived from sources other than said section 1 of title XIII of the act of June 15, 1917, are incorporated in sections 1364 and 2275 of this title . Senate Revision Amendment Words ", except the Canal Zone." were substituted for the period in this section by Senate amendment. See Senate Report No. 1620, amendment No. 2, 80th Cong. Editorial Notes References in Text For definition of Canal Zone, referred to in text, see section 3602(b) of Title 22 , Foreign Relations and Intercourse. §6. Department and agency defined As used in this title: The term "department" means one of the executive departments enumerated in section 1 of Title 5 , unless the context shows that such term was intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the government. The term "agency" includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685 .) Historical and Revision Notes This section defines the terms "department" and "agency" of the United States. The word "department" appears 57 times in title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the word "agency" 14 times. It was considered necessary to define clearly these words in order to avoid possible litigation as to the scope or coverage of a given section containing such words. (See United States v. Germaine , 1878, 99 U.S. 508, 25 L. Ed. 482, for definition of words "department" or "head of department.") The phrase "corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest" is intended to include those governmental corporations in which stock is not actually issued, as well as those in which stock is owned by the United States. It excludes those corporations in which the interest of the Government is custodial or incidental. Editorial Notes References in Text Section 1 of Title 5 , referred to in text, was repealed by Pub. L. 89–554, §8, Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 632 , and reenacted by the first section thereof as section 101 of Title 5 , Government Organization and Employees. §7. Special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States defined The term "special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States", as used in this title, includes: (1) The high seas, any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, and any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof, when such vessel is within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State. (2) Any vessel registered, licensed, or enrolled under the laws of the United States, and being on a voyage upon the waters of any of the Great Lakes, or any of the waters connecting them, or upon the Saint Lawrence River where the same constitutes the International Boundary Line.

(4) Any island, rock, or key containing deposits of guano, which may, at the discretion of the President, be considered as appertaining to the United States. (5) Any aircraft belonging in whole or in part to the United States, or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, district, or possession thereof, while such aircraft is in flight over the high seas, or over any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State. (6) Any vehicle used or designed for flight or navigation in space and on the registry of the United States pursuant to the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies and the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, while that vehicle is in flight, which is from the moment when all external doors are closed on Earth following embarkation until the moment when one such door is opened on Earth for disembarkation or in the case of a forced landing, until the competent authorities take over the responsibility for the vehicle and for persons and property aboard. (7) Any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to an offense by or against a national of the United States.

(9) With respect to offenses committed by or against a national of the United States as that term is used in section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act— (A) the premises of United States diplomatic, consular, military or other United States Government missions or entities in foreign States, including the buildings, parts of buildings, and land appurtenant or ancillary thereto or used for purposes of those missions or entities, irrespective of ownership; and (B) residences in foreign States and the land appurtenant or ancillary thereto, irrespective of ownership, used for purposes of those missions or entities or used by United States personnel assigned to those missions or entities. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to supersede any treaty or international agreement with which this paragraph conflicts. This paragraph does not apply with respect to an offense committed by a person described in section 3261(a) of this title .

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §451 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §272, 35 Stat. 1142 ; June 11, 1940, ch. 323, 54 Stat. 304 ). The words "The term 'special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States' as used in this title includes:" were substituted for the words "The crimes and offenses defined in sections 451–468 of this title shall be punished as herein prescribed." This section first appeared in the 1909 Criminal Code. It made it possible to combine in one chapter all the penal provisions covering acts within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction without the necessity of repeating in each section the places covered. The present section has made possible the allocation of the diverse provisions of chapter 11 of Title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., to particular chapters restricted to particular offenses, as contemplated by the alphabetical chapter arrangement. In several revised sections of said chapter 11 the words "within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States" have been added. Thus the jurisdictional limitation will be preserved in all sections of said chapter 11 describing an offense. Enumeration of names of Great Lakes was omitted as unnecessary. Other minor changes were necessary now that the section defines a term rather than the place of commission of crime or offense; however, the extent of the special jurisdiction as originally enacted has been carefully followed.

L. 104–132, title IX, §901(a), Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1317 , provided that: "The Congress declares that all the territorial sea of the United States, as defined by Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988 [set out as a note under section 1331 of Title 43 , Public Lands], for purposes of Federal criminal jurisdiction is part of the United States, subject to its sovereignty, and is within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States for the purposes of title 18, United States Code ." §8. Obligation or other security of the United States defined The term "obligation or other security of the United States" includes all bonds, certificates of indebtedness, national bank currency, Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve bank notes, coupons, United States notes, Treasury notes, gold certificates, silver certificates, fractional notes, certificates of deposit, bills, checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of the United States, stamps and other representatives of value, of whatever denomination, issued under any Act of Congress, and canceled United States stamps. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §261 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §147, 35 Stat. 1115 ; Jan. 27, 1938, ch. 10, §3, 52 Stat. 7 ). The terms of this section were general enough to justify its inclusion in this chapter rather than retaining it in the chapter on "Counterfeiting" where the terms which it specifically defines are set out in sections 471–476, 478, 481, 483, 492, and 504 of this title . Words "Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve bank notes" were inserted before "coupons" because such notes have almost supplanted national bank currency. Minor changes were made in phraseology. §9. Vessel of the United States defined The term "vessel of the United States", as used in this title, means a vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States, or any citizen thereof, or any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §501 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §310, 35 Stat. 1148 ). Section is made applicable to the entire title rather than to sections 481 et seq. of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. Minor changes in phraseology were made. §10. Interstate commerce and foreign commerce defined The term "interstate commerce", as used in this title, includes commerce between one State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia and another State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia. The term "foreign commerce", as used in this title, includes commerce with a foreign country. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 686 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§408, 408b, 414(a), and 419a(b) ( Oct. 29, 1919, ch. 89, §2(b), 41 Stat. 325 ; June 22, 1932, ch. 271, §2, 47 Stat. 326 ; May 18, 1934, ch. 301, 48 Stat. 782 ; May 22, 1934, ch. 333, §2(a), 48 Stat. 794 ; Aug. 18, 1941, ch. 366, §2(b), 55 Stat. 631 ). This section consolidates into one section identical definitions contained in sections 408, 408b, 414(a), and 419a(b) of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. In addition to slight improvements in style, the word "commerce" was substituted for "transportation" in order to avoid the narrower connotation of the word "transportation" since "commerce" obviously includes more than "transportation." The word "Possession" was inserted in two places to make the definition more accurate and comprehensive since the places included in the word "Possession" would normally be within the term defined and a narrower construction should be handled by express statutory exclusion in those crimes which Congress intends to restrict to commerce within the continental United States. §11. Foreign government defined The term "foreign government", as used in this title except in sections 112, 878, 970, 1116, and 1201, includes any government, faction, or body of insurgents within a country with which the United States is at peace, irrespective of recognition by the United States. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 686 ; Pub. L. 94–467, §11, Oct. 8, 1976, 90 Stat. 2001 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§98, 288, 349; section 235 of title 22 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse; section 41 of title 50 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense ( June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title VIII, §4, 40 Stat. 226 ). The definition of "foreign government" contained in this section, with minor changes in phraseology, is from section 4 of title VIII of act June 15, 1917 (Ch. 30, 40 Stat. 217 , 226 ), known as the Espionage Act of 1917. This definition was incorporated in sections 98, 288, and 349 of title 18 and in section 235 of title 22 , Foreign Relations and Intercourse, and in section 41 of Title 50 , War and National Defense, U.S.C., all in 1940 ed., since the definition was specifically enacted with reference to said sections and others not material here. The remaining provisions of said sections 98 and 349 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were derived from sources other than said section 4 of title VIII of the act of June 15, 1917, are incorporated in sections 502 and 957 of this title . Editorial Notes Amendments 1976 — Pub. L. 94–467 inserted "except in sections 112, 878, 970, 1116, and 1201" after "title". §12. United States Postal Service defined As used in this title, the term "Postal Service" means the United States Postal Service established under title 39, and every officer and employee of that Service, whether or not such officer or employee has taken the oath of office. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 686 ; Pub. L. 91–375, §6(j)(2), Aug. 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 777 ; Pub. L. 101–647, title XXXV, §3505, Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 4921 .)

This section consolidates sections 301 and 360 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1990 — Pub. L. 101–647 substituted "whether or not such officer or employee has taken the oath of office" for "whether he has taken the oath of office". 1970 — Pub. L. 91–375 inserted "United States" before "Postal Service" in section catchline and substituted in text as definition of "Postal Service" the United States Postal Service established under title 39, and every officer and employee of that Service, whether he has taken the oath of office, for prior definition which included the Post Office Department and every employee, thereof, whether or not he has taken the oath of office. Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Effective Date of 1970 Amendment Amendment by Pub. L. 91–375 effective within 1 year after Aug. 12, 1970, on date established therefor by the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service and published by it in the Federal Register, see section 15(a) of Pub.

Laws of States adopted for areas within Federal jurisdiction (a) Whoever within or upon any of the places now existing or hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section 7 of this title , or on, above, or below any portion of the territorial sea of the United States not within the jurisdiction of any State, Commonwealth, territory, possession, or district is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession, or District in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment. (b)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, that which may or shall be imposed through judicial or administrative action under the law of a State, territory, possession, or district, for a conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol, shall be considered to be a punishment provided by that law. Any limitation on the right or privilege to operate a motor vehicle imposed under this subsection shall apply only to the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. (2)(A) In addition to any term of imprisonment provided for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol imposed under the law of a State, territory, possession, or district, the punishment for such an offense under this section shall include an additional term of imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or if serious bodily injury of a minor is caused, not more than 5 years, or if death of a minor is caused, not more than 10 years, and an additional fine under this title, or both, if— (i) a minor (other than the offender) was present in the motor vehicle when the offense was committed; and (ii) the law of the State, territory, possession, or district in which the offense occurred does not provide an additional term of imprisonment under the circumstances described in clause (i). (B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "minor" means a person less than 18 years of age. (c) Whenever any waters of the territorial sea of the United States lie outside the territory of any State, Commonwealth, territory, possession, or district, such waters (including the airspace above and the seabed and subsoil below, and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon) shall be deemed, for purposes of subsection (a), to lie within the area of the State, Commonwealth, territory, possession, or district that it would lie within if the boundaries of such State, Commonwealth, territory, possession, or district were extended seaward to the outer limit of the territorial sea of the United States.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §468 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §289, 35 Stat. 1145 ; June 15, 1933, ch. 85, 48 Stat. 152 ; June 20, 1935, ch. 284, 49 Stat. 394 ; June 6, 1940, ch. 241, 54 Stat. 234 ). Act March 4, 1909, §289 used the words "now in force" when referring to the laws of any State, organized Territory or district, to be considered in force. As amended on June 15, 1933, the words "by the laws thereof in force on June 1, 1933, and remaining in force at the time of the doing or omitting the doing of such act or thing, would be penal," were used. The amendment of June 20, 1935, extended the date to "April 1, 1935," and the amendment of June 6, 1940, extended the date to "February 1, 1940". The revised section omits the specification of any date as unnecessary in a revision, which speaks from the date of its enactment. Such omission will not only make effective within Federal reservations, the local State laws in force on the date of the enactment of the revision, but will authorize the Federal courts to apply the same measuring stick to such offenses as is applied in the adjoining State under future changes of the State law and will make unnecessary periodic pro forma amendments of this section to keep abreast of changes of local laws. In other words, the revised section makes applicable to offenses committed on such reservations, the law of the place that would govern if the reservation had not been ceded to the United States. The word "Possession" was inserted to clarify scope of section. Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1996 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 104–132, §901(b)(1), inserted "or on, above, or below any portion of the territorial sea of the United States not within the jurisdiction of any State, Commonwealth, territory, possession, or district" after " section 7 of this title ,".

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §145 and §§676, 682, 683, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation ( Jan. 24, 1905, ch. 137, §2, 33 Stat. 614 ; June 29, 1906, ch. 3593, §2, 34 Stat. 607 ; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §84, 35 Stat. 1104 ; Aug. 11, 1916, ch. 313, 39 Stat. 476 ; June 5, 1920, ch. 247, §2, 41 Stat. 986 ; Apr. 15, 1924, ch. 108, 43 Stat. 98 ; Feb. 28, 1925, ch. 376, 43 Stat. 1091 ; July 3, 1926, ch. 744, §6, 44 Stat. 821 ; July 3, 1926, ch. 776, §3, 44 Stat. 889 ; June 28, 1930, ch. 709, §2, 46 Stat. 828 ; Mar. 10, 1934, ch. 54, §2, 48 Stat. 400 ; Reorg. Plan No. II, §4(f), 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433 ). This revised section condenses, consolidates, and simplifies similar provisions of sections 676, 682, 683, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 145 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., with such changes of phraseology as make clear the intent of Congress to protect all wildlife within Federal sanctuaries, refuges, fish hatcheries, and breeding grounds. Irrelevant provisions of such sections in title 16 are to be retained in that title. Because of the general nature of this consolidated section, no specific reference is made to rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior or any other personage, but only to rules and regulations "promulgated by authority of law". The punishment provided by the sections consolidated varied from a fine not exceeding $100 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or both, in section 694a of title 16 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year, or both, in sections 676, 685, and 688 of such title 16. The revised section adopts the punishment provisions of the other five sections. The references to "misdemeanor" in sections 676, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "misdemeanor" in section 1 of this title , and also to conform with policy followed by codifiers of the 1909 Criminal Code, as stated in Senate Report 10, part 1, pages 12, 13, 14, Sixtieth Congress, first session, to accompany S. 2982. Words "upon conviction", contained in sections 676, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as surplusage, because punishment can be imposed only after conviction. Words "in any United States court of competent jurisdiction", in sections 676, 685, and 688 of title 16 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., words "in any United States court", in sections 689b, 692a, and 694a of such title 16, and words "in the discretion of the court", in said sections 676, 685, 688, and 689b, were likewise omitted as surplusage. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $500". §42. Importation or shipment of injurious mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibia, and reptiles; permits, specimens for museums; regulations (a)(1) The importation into the United States, any territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States, or any shipment between the continental United States, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States, of the mongoose of the species Herpestes auropunctatus; of the species of so-called "flying foxes" or fruit bats of the genus Pteropus; of the zebra mussel of the species Dreissena polymorpha; of the quagga mussel of the species Dreissena rostriformis or Dreissena bugensis; of the bighead carp of the species Hypophthalmichthys nobilis; and such other species of wild mammals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, reptiles, brown tree snakes, or the offspring or eggs of any of the foregoing which the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe by regulation to be injurious to human beings, to the interests of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or to wildlife or the wildlife resources of the United States, is hereby prohibited. All such prohibited mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, and reptiles, and the eggs or offspring therefrom, shall be promptly exported or destroyed at the expense of the importer or consignee. Nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal or modify any provision of the Public Health Service Act or Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Also, this section shall not authorize any action with respect to the importation of any plant pest as defined in the Federal Plant Pest Act, 1 insofar as such importation is subject to regulation under that Act. (2) As used in this subsection, the term "wild" relates to any creatures that, whether or not raised in captivity, normally are found in a wild state; and the terms "wildlife" and "wildlife resources" include those resources that comprise wild mammals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), and all other classes of wild creatures whatsoever, and all types of aquatic and land vegetation upon which such wildlife resources are dependent. (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary of the Interior, when he finds that there has been a proper showing of responsibility and continued protection of the public interest and health, shall permit the importation for zoological, educational, medical, and scientific purposes of any mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibia, and reptiles, or the offspring or eggs thereof, where such importation would be prohibited otherwise by or pursuant to this Act, and this Act shall not restrict importations by Federal agencies for their own use. (4) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the importation of dead natural-history specimens for museums or for scientific collections, or the importation of domesticated canaries, parrots (including all other species of psittacine birds), or such other cage birds as the Secretary of the Interior may designate. (5) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior shall enforce the provisions of this subsection, including any regulations issued hereunder, and, if requested by the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Treasury may require the furnishing of an appropriate bond when desirable to insure compliance with such provisions. (b) Whoever violates this section, or any regulation issued pursuant thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. (c) The Secretary of the Interior within one hundred and eighty days of the enactment of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 shall prescribe such requirements and issue such permits as he may deem necessary for the transportation of wild animals and birds under humane and healthful conditions, and it shall be unlawful for any person, including any importer, knowingly to cause or permit any wild animal or bird to be transported to the United States, or any Territory or district thereof, under inhumane or unhealthful conditions or in violation of such requirements. In any criminal prosecution for violation of this subsection and in any administrative proceeding for the suspension of the issuance of further permits— (1) the condition of any vessel or conveyance, or the enclosures in which wild animals or birds are confined therein, upon its arrival in the United States, or any Territory or district thereof, shall constitute relevant evidence in determining whether the provisions of this subsection have been violated; and (2) the presence in such vessel or conveyance at such time of a substantial ratio of dead, crippled, diseased, or starving wild animals or birds shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the violation of the provisions of this subsection.

Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§391, 394 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§241, 244, 35 Stat. 1137 , 1138 ; June 15, 1935, ch. 261, title II, §201, 49 Stat. 381 ; Reorg. Plan No. II, §4(f), 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433 ). This section consolidates the provisions of sections 391 and 394 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., as subsections (a) and (b), respectively. In subsection (a) the words "Territory or District thereof" were omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of the United States in section 5 of this title . In subsection (b) the words "upon conviction thereof", were omitted as surplusage because punishment can only be imposed after conviction. The amount of the fine was reduced from $1,000 to $500, thus making the violation a petty offense as defined in section 1 of this title . (See also section 41 of this title which provides a similar punishment.) Minor verbal changes were also made. 1949 Act This section [section 2] incorporates in section 42 of title 18 , U.S.C., with slight changes in phraseology, the provisions of act of June 29, 1948 (ch. 716, 62 Stat. 1096 ), which became law subsequent to the enactment of the revision of title 18.

Findings Pub. L. 111–294, §2, Dec. 9, 2010, 124 Stat. 3177 , provided that: "The Congress finds the following: "(1) The United States has a long history of prohibiting the interstate sale, marketing, advertising, exchange, and distribution of obscene material and speech that is integral to criminal conduct. "(2) The Federal Government and the States have a compelling interest in preventing intentional acts of extreme animal cruelty. "(3) Each of the several States and the District of Columbia criminalize intentional acts of extreme animal cruelty, such as the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, or impaling of animals for no socially redeeming purpose. "(4) There are certain extreme acts of animal cruelty that appeal to a specific sexual fetish. These acts of extreme animal cruelty are videotaped, and the resulting video tapes are commonly referred to as 'animal crush videos'. "(5) The Supreme Court of the United States has long held that obscenity is an exception to speech protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. "(6) In the judgment of Congress, many animal crush videos are obscene in the sense that the depictions, taken as a whole— "(A) appeal to the prurient interest in sex; "(B) are patently offensive; and "(C) lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. "(7) Serious criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty are integral to the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos. "(8) The creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos is intrinsically related and integral to creating an incentive for, directly causing, and perpetuating demand for the serious acts of extreme animal cruelty the videos depict. The primary reason for those criminal acts is the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of the animal crush video image. "(9) The serious acts of extreme animal cruelty necessary to make animal crush videos are committed in a clandestine manner that— "(A) allows the perpetrators of such crimes to remain anonymous; "(B) makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the jurisdiction within which the underlying criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty occurred; and "(C) often precludes proof that the criminal acts occurred within the statute of limitations. "(10) Each of the difficulties described in paragraph (9) seriously frustrates and impedes the ability of State authorities to enforce the criminal statutes prohibiting such behavior." §49. Enforcement of animal fighting prohibitions (a) In General .—Whoever violates subsection (a)(1), (b), (c), or (d) of section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both, for each violation. (b) Attending an Animal Fighting Venture .—Whoever violates subsection (a)(2)(A) of section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act ( 7 U.S.C. 2156 ) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both, for each violation. (c) Causing an Individual Who Has Not Attained the Age of 16 To Attend an Animal Fighting Venture .—Whoever violates subsection (a)(2)(B) of section 26 ( 7 U.S.C. 2156 ) of the Animal Welfare Act shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 3 years, or both, for each violation.

CHAPTER 5 —ARSON Sec. 81. Arson within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. §81. Arson within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction Whoever, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, willfully and maliciously sets fire to or burns any building, structure or vessel, any machinery or building materials or supplies, military or naval stores, munitions of war, or any structural aids or appliances for navigation or shipping, or attempts or conspires to do such an act, shall be imprisoned for not more than 25 years, fined the greater of the fine under this title or the cost of repairing or replacing any property that is damaged or destroyed, or both. If the building be a dwelling or if the life of any person be placed in jeopardy, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both.

L. 107–56, title VIII, §§810(a), 811(a), Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 380 , 381 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§464, 465 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§285, 286, 35 Stat. 1144 ). Sections were consolidated and rewritten both as to form and substance and that part of each section relating to destruction of property by means other than burning constitutes section 1363 of this title . The words "within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States" were added to preserve existing limitations of territorial applicability. (See section 7 of this title and note thereunder.) The phrase "any building, structure, or vessel, any machinery or building materials and supplies, military or naval stores, munitions of war or any structural aids or appliances for navigation or shipping" was substituted for "any dwelling house, or any store, barn, stable, or other building, parcel of a dwelling house", in section 464 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., and "any arsenal, armory, magazine, rope walk, ship house, warehouse, blockhouse, or barrack, or any storehouse, barn or stable, not parcel of a dwelling house, or any other building not mentioned in the section last preceding, or any vessel, built, building, or undergoing repair, or any lighthouse, or beacon, or any machinery, timber, cables, rigging, or other materials or appliances for building, repairing or fitting out vessels, or any pile of wood, boards, or other lumber, or any military, naval or victualing stores, arms, or other munitions of war", in section 465 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. The substituted phrase is a concise and comprehensive description of the things enumerated in both sections. The punishment provisions are new and are graduated with some regard to the gravity of the offense. It was felt that a possible punishment of 20 years for burning a wood pile or injuring or destroying an outbuilding was disproportionate and not in harmony with recent legislation. Editorial Notes Amendments 2001 — Pub. L. 107–56, in first par., struck out ", or attempts to set fire to or burn" after "maliciously sets fire to or burns" and inserted "or attempts or conspires to do such an act," before "shall be imprisoned" and, in second par., substituted "for any term of years or for life" for "not more than twenty years". 1996 — Pub. L. 104–132, in first par., substituted "imprisoned for not more than 25 years, fined the greater of the fine under this title or the cost of repairing or replacing any property that is damaged or destroyed, or both" for "fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both". 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000" in first par. and for "fined not more than $5,000" in second par. CHAPTER 7 —ASSAULT Sec. 111.

L. 92–539, title III, §302, Oct. 24, 1972, 86 Stat. 1073 , substituted "Protection of foreign officials and official guests" for "Assaulting certain foreign diplomatic and other official personnel" in item 112. 1964 — Pub. L. 88–493, §2, Aug. 27, 1964, 78 Stat. 610 , substituted "certain foreign diplomatic and other official personnel" for "public minister" in item 112. 1 Editorially supplied. Section 117 added by Pub. L. 109–162 without corresponding amendment of chapter analysis. §111. Assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers or employees (a) In General .—Whoever— (1) forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated in section 1114 of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties; or (2) forcibly assaults or intimidates any person who formerly served as a person designated in section 1114 on account of the performance of official duties during such person's term of service, shall, where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both, and where such acts involve physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both. (b) Enhanced Penalty .—Whoever, in the commission of any acts described in subsection (a), uses a deadly or dangerous weapon (including a weapon intended to cause death or danger but that fails to do so by reason of a defective component) or inflicts bodily injury, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. (c) Extraterritorial Jurisdiction .—There is extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct prohibited by this section. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 688 ; Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§118, 254 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §62, 35 Stat. 1100 ; May 18, 1934, ch. 299, §2, 48 Stat. 781 ). This section consolidates sections 118 and 254 with changes in phraseology and substance necessary to effect the consolidation. Also the words "Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture" appearing in section 118 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were inserted in enumeration of Federal officers and employees in section 1114 of this title . The punishment provision of section 254 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., was adopted as the latest expression of Congressional intent. This consolidation eliminates a serious incongruity in punishment and application. Editorial Notes Amendments 2021 —Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 117–59 added subsec. (c). 2008 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 110–177 substituted "where such acts involve physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony" for "in all other cases" in concluding provisions. 2002 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 107–273, §11008(b)(1), substituted "8" for "three" in concluding provisions. Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 107–273, §11008(b)(2), substituted "20" for "ten". 1996 —Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 104–132 inserted "(including a weapon intended to cause death or danger but that fails to do so by reason of a defective component)" after "deadly or dangerous weapon". 1994 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 103–322, §320101(a)(1), inserted ", where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both, and in all other cases," after "shall" in concluding provisions. Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 103–322, §320101(a)(2), inserted "or inflicts bodily injury" after "weapon". 1988 — Pub. L. 100–690 amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: "Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated in section 1114 of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. "Whoever, in the commission of any such acts uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both."

Sense of Congress Regarding Amendment by Pub. L. 117–59 For sense of Congress regarding amendment to this section by Pub. L. 117–59, see section 2(6) of Pub. L. 117–59, set out as a note under section 1114 of this title . §112. Protection of foreign officials, official guests, and internationally protected persons (a) Whoever assaults, strikes, wounds, imprisons, or offers violence to a foreign official, official guest, or internationally protected person or makes any other violent attack upon the person or liberty of such person, or, if likely to endanger his person or liberty, makes a violent attack upon his official premises, private accommodation, or means of transport or attempts to commit any of the foregoing shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. Whoever in the commission of any such act uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, or inflicts bodily injury, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. (b) Whoever willfully— (1) intimidates, coerces, threatens, or harasses a foreign official or an official guest or obstructs a foreign official in the performance of his duties; (2) attempts to intimidate, coerce, threaten, or harass a foreign official or an official guest or obstruct a foreign official in the performance of his duties; or (3) within the United States and within one hundred feet of any building or premises in whole or in part owned, used, or occupied for official business or for diplomatic, consular, or residential purposes by— (A) a foreign government, including such use as a mission to an international organization; (B) an international organization; (C) a foreign official; or (D) an official guest; congregates with two or more other persons with intent to violate any other provision of this section; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. (c) For the purpose of this section "foreign government", "foreign official", "internationally protected person", "international organization", "national of the United States", and "official guest" shall have the same meanings as those provided in section 1116(b) of this title . (d) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed under the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. (e) If the victim of an offense under subsection (a) is an internationally protected person outside the United States, the United States may exercise jurisdiction over the offense if (1) the victim is a representative, officer, employee, or agent of the United States, (2) an offender is a national of the United States, or (3) an offender is afterwards found in the United States. As used in this subsection, the United States includes all areas under the jurisdiction of the United States including any of the places within the provisions of sections 5 and 7 of this title and section 46501(2) of title 49 . (f) In the course of enforcement of subsection (a) and any other sections prohibiting a conspiracy or attempt to violate subsection (a), the Attorney General may request assistance from any Federal, State, or local agency, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, any statute, rule, or regulation to the contrary, notwithstanding.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 255 of title 22 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse ( R.S. §4062 ). Punishment provision was rewritten to make it more definite by substituting a maximum of $5,000 in lieu of the words "fined at the discretion of the court." As thus revised this provision conforms with the first punishment provision of section 111 of this title . So, also, the greater punishment provided by the second paragraph of section 111 was added to this section for offenses involving the use of dangerous weapons.

Congressional Findings and Purpose Pub. L. 116–309, §2, Jan. 5, 2021, 134 Stat. 4922 , provided that: "The Congress finds the following: "(1) Female genital mutilation is recognized internationally as a human rights violation and a form of child abuse, gender discrimination, and violence against women and girls. Female genital mutilation is a global problem whose eradication requires international cooperation and enforcement at the national level. The United States should demonstrate its commitment to the rights of women and girls by leading the way in the international community in banning this abhorrent practice. "(2) Congress has previously prohibited the commission of female genital mutilation on minors. Female genital mutilation is a heinous practice that often inflicts excruciating pain on its victims and causes them to suffer grave physical and psychological harm. "(3) Congress has the power under article I, section 8 of the Constitution to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution treaties entered into by the United States. "(4) Congress also has the power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit female genital mutilation. An international market for the practice exists, and persons who perform female genital mutilation in other countries typically earn a living from doing so. "(5) Those who perform this conduct often rely on a connection to interstate or foreign commerce, such as interstate or foreign travel, the transmission or receipt of communications in interstate or foreign commerce, the use of instruments traded in interstate or foreign commerce, or payments of any kind in furtherance of this conduct. "(6) Amending the statute to specify a link to interstate or foreign commerce would confirm that Congress has the affirmative power to prohibit this conduct." Sense of the Congress Pub. L. 116–309, §5, Jan. 5, 2021, 134 Stat. 4924 , provided that: "It is the sense of the Congress that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan erred in invalidating the prior version of such section 116 [this section] (See United States v. Nagarwala, 350 F. Supp. 3d 613, 631 (E.D. Mich. 2018)). The commercial nature of female genital mutilation (hereinafter in this section referred to as 'FGM') is 'self-evident,' meaning that the 'absence of particularized findings' about the commercial nature of FGM in the predecessor statute did not 'call into question Congress's authority to legislate' (Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 21 (2005)). Nevertheless, the Congress has elected to amend the FGM statute to clarify the commercial nature of the conduct that this statute regulates. But, by doing so, Congress does not hereby ratify the district court's erroneous interpretation in Nagarwala." Congressional Findings Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title VI, §645(a), Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–708 , provided that: "The Congress finds that— "(1) the practice of female genital mutilation is carried out by members of certain cultural and religious groups within the United States; "(2) the practice of female genital mutilation often results in the occurrence of physical and psychological health effects that harm the women involved; "(3) such mutilation infringes upon the guarantees of rights secured by Federal and State law, both statutory and constitutional; "(4) the unique circumstances surrounding the practice of female genital mutilation place it beyond the ability of any single State or local jurisdiction to control; "(5) the practice of female genital mutilation can be prohibited without abridging the exercise of any rights guaranteed under the first amendment to the Constitution or under any other law; and "(6) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of article I, the necessary and proper clause, section 5 of the fourteenth Amendment, as well as under the treaty clause, to the Constitution to enact such legislation." §117. Domestic assault by an habitual offender (a) In General .—Any person who commits a domestic assault within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States or Indian country and who has a final conviction on at least 2 separate prior occasions in Federal, State, or Indian tribal court proceedings for offenses that would be, if subject to Federal jurisdiction— (1) any assault, sexual abuse, or serious violent felony against a spouse or intimate partner, or against a child of or in the care of the person committing the domestic assault; or (2) an offense under chapter 110A , shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for a term of not more than 5 years, or both, except that if substantial bodily injury results from violation under this section, the offender shall be imprisoned for a term of not more than 10 years.

(Added Pub. L. 108–458, title VI, §6906, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3773 .) Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Findings and Purpose Pub. L. 108–458, title VI, §6902, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3769 , provided that: "(a) Findings .—Congress makes the following findings: "(1) The criminal use of man-portable air defense systems (referred to in this section as 'MANPADS') presents a serious threat to civil aviation worldwide, especially in the hands of terrorists or foreign states that harbor them. "(2) Atomic weapons or weapons designed to release radiation (commonly known as 'dirty bombs') could be used by terrorists to inflict enormous loss of life and damage to property and the environment. "(3) Variola virus is the causative agent of smallpox, an extremely serious, contagious, and sometimes fatal disease. Variola virus is classified as a Category A agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning that it is believed to pose the greatest potential threat for adverse public health impact and has a moderate to high potential for large-scale dissemination. The last case of smallpox in the United States was in 1949. The last naturally occurring case in the world was in Somalia in 1977. Although smallpox has been officially eradicated after a successful worldwide vaccination program, there remain two official repositories of the variola virus for research purposes. Because it is so dangerous, the variola virus may appeal to terrorists. "(4) The use, or even the threatened use, of MANPADS, atomic or radiological weapons, or the variola virus, against the United States, its allies, or its people, poses a grave risk to the security, foreign policy, economy, and environment of the United States. Accordingly, the United States has a compelling national security interest in preventing unlawful activities that lead to the proliferation or spread of such items, including their unauthorized production, construction, acquisition, transfer, possession, import, or export. All of these activities markedly increase the chances that such items will be obtained by terrorist organizations or rogue states, which could use them to attack the United States, its allies, or United States nationals or corporations. "(5) There is no legitimate reason for a private individual or company, absent explicit government authorization, to produce, construct, otherwise acquire, transfer, receive, possess, import, export, or use MANPADS, atomic or radiological weapons, or the variola virus. "(b) Purpose .—The purpose of this subtitle [subtitle J (§§6901–6911) of title VI of Pub. L. 108–458, see Short Title of 2004 Amendment note set out under section 1 of this title ] is to combat the potential use of weapons that have the ability to cause widespread harm to United States persons and the United States economy (and that have no legitimate private use) and to threaten or harm the national security or foreign relations of the United States." §176. Seizure, forfeiture, and destruction (a) In General .—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Attorney General may request the issuance, in the same manner as provided for a search warrant, of a warrant authorizing the seizure of any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system that— (A) pertains to conduct prohibited under section 175 of this title ; or (B) is of a type or in a quantity that under the circumstances has no apparent justification for prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes. (2) In exigent circumstances, seizure and destruction of any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) may be made upon probable cause without the necessity for a warrant. (b) Procedure .—Property seized pursuant to subsection (a) shall be forfeited to the United States after notice to potential claimants and an opportunity for a hearing. At such hearing, the Government shall bear the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. Except as inconsistent herewith, the same procedures and provisions of law relating to a forfeiture under the customs laws shall extend to a seizure or forfeiture under this section. The Attorney General may provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system seized and forfeited pursuant to this section. (c) Affirmative Defense .—It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section that— (1) such biological agent, toxin, or delivery system is for a prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purpose; and (2) such biological agent, toxin, or delivery system, is of a type and quantity reasonable for that purpose.

Memorandum of Attorney General Regarding Conflict of Interest Provisions of Public Law 87–849, Feb. 1, 1963, 28 F.R. 985 January 28, 1963. Public Law 87–849, "To strengthen the criminal laws relating to bribery, graft, and conflicts of interest, and for other purposes," came into force January 21, 1963. A number of departments and agencies of the Government have suggested that the Department of Justice prepare and distribute a memorandum analyzing the conflict of interest provisions contained in the new act. I am therefore distributing the attached memorandum. One of the main purposes of the new legislation merits specific mention. That purpose is to help the Government obtain the temporary or intermittent services of persons with special knowledge and skills whose principal employment is outside the Government. For the most part the conflict of interest statutes superseded by Public Law 87–849 imposed the same restraints on a person serving the Government temporarily or intermittently as on a full-time employee, and those statutes often had an unnecessarily severe impact on the former. As a result, they impeded the departments and agencies in the recruitment of experts for important work. Public Law 87–849 meets this difficulty by imposing a lesser array of prohibitions on temporary and intermittent employees than on regular employees. I believe that a widespread appreciation of this aspect of the new law will lead to a significant expansion of the pool of talent on which the departments and agencies can draw for their special needs. Robert F. Kennedy, Attorney General. Memorandum re the Conflict of Interest Provisions of Public Law 87–849, 76 Stat. 1119 , Approved October 23, 1962 Introduction Public Law 87–849, which came into force January 21, 1963, affected seven statutes which applied to officers and employees of the Government and were generally spoken of as the "conflict of interest" laws. These included six sections of the criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 216, 281, 283, 284, 434 and 1914, and a statute containing no penalties, section 190 of the Revised Statutes ( 5 U.S.C. 99 ). Public Law 87–849 (sometimes referred to hereinafter as "the Act") repealed section 190 and one of the criminal statutes, 18 U.S.C. 216, without replacing them. 1 In addition it repealed and supplanted the other five criminal statutes. It is the purpose of this memorandum to summarize the new law and to describe the principal differences between it and the legislation it has replaced. The Act accomplished its revisions by enacting new sections 203, 205, 207, 208 and 209 of title 18 of the United States Code and providing that they supplant the above-mentioned sections 281, 283, 284, 434 and 1914 of title 18 respectively. 2 It will be convenient, therefore, after summarizing the principal provisions of the new sections, to examine each section separately, comparing it with its precursor before passing to the next. First of all, however, it is necessary to describe the background and provisions of the new 18 U.S.C. 202(a), which has no counterpart among the statutes formerly in effect. Special Government Employees [New 18 U.S.C. 202(a) ] In the main the prior conflict of interest laws imposed the same restrictions on individuals who serve the Government intermittently or for a short period of time as on those who serve full-time. The consequences of this generalized treatment were pointed out in the following paragraph of the Senate Judiciary Committee report on the bill which became Public Law 87–849 : 3 In considering the application of present law in relation to the Government's utilization of temporary or intermittent consultants and advisers, it must be emphasized that most of the existing conflict-of-interest statutes were enacted in the 19th century—that is, at a time when persons outside the Government rarely served it in this way. The laws were therefore directed at activities of regular Government employees, and their present impact on the occasionally needed experts—those whose main work is performed outside the Government—is unduly severe. This harsh impact constitutes an appreciable deterrent to the Government's obtaining needed part-time services. The recruiting problem noted by the Committee generated a major part of the impetus for the enactment of Public Law 87–849 . The Act dealt with the problem by creating a category of Government employees termed "special Government employees" and by excepting persons in this category from certain of the prohibitions imposed on ordinary employees. The new 18 U.S.C. 202(a) defines the term "special Government employee" to include, among others, officers and employees of the departments and agencies who are appointed or employed to serve, with or without compensation, for not more than 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days either on a full-time or intermittent basis. Summary of the Main Conflict of Interest Provisions of Public Law 87–849 A regular officer or employee of the Government—that is, one appointed or employed to serve more than 130 days in any period of 365 days—is in general subject to the following major prohibitions (the citations are to the new sections of Title 18): 1. He may not, except in the discharge of his official duties, represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest. This prohibition applies both to paid and unpaid representation of another ( 18 U.S.C. 203 and 205 ). 2. He may not participate in his governmental capacity in any matter in which he, his spouse, minor child, outside business associate or person with whom he is negotiating for employment has a financial interest ( 18 U.S.C. 208 ). 3. He may not, after his Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and in which he participated personally and substantially for the Government ( 18 U.S.C. 207(a) ). 4. He may not, for 1 year after his Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and which was within the boundaries of his official responsibilities 4 during the last year of his Government service ( 18 U.S.C. 207(b) ). This temporary restraint of course gives way to the permanent restraint described in paragraph 3 if the matter is one in which he participated personally and substantially. 5. He may not receive any salary, or supplementation of his Government salary, from a private source as compensation for his services to the Government ( 18 U.S.C. 209 ). A special Government employee is in general subject only to the following major prohibitions: 1. (a) He may not, except in the discharge of his official duties, represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a matter in which the United States is a party or has in interest and in which he has at any time participated personally and substantially for the Government ( 18 U.S.C. 203 and 205 ). (b) He may not, except in the discharge of his official duties, represent anyone else in a matter pending before the agency he serves unless he has served there no more than 60 days during the past 365 ( 18 U.S.C. 203 and 205 ). He is bound by this restraint despite the fact that the matter is not one in which he has ever participated personally and substantially. The restrictions described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) apply to both paid and unpaid representation of another. These restrictions in combination are, of course, less extensive than the one described in the corresponding paragraph 1 in the list set forth above with regard to regular employees. 2. He may not participate in his governmental capacity in any matter in which he, his spouse, minor child, outside business associate or person with whom he is negotiating for employment has a financial interest ( 18 U.S.C. 208 ). 3. He may not, after his Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and in which he participated personally and substantially for the Government ( 18 U.S.C. 207(a) ). 4. He may not, for 1 year after his Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and which was within the boundaries of his official responsibility during the last year of his Government service ( 18 U.S.C. 207(b) ). This temporary restraint of course gives way to the permanent restriction described in paragraph 3 if the matter is one in which he participated personally and substantially. It will be seen that paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 for special Government employees are the same as the corresponding paragraphs for regular employees. Paragraph 5 for the latter, describing the bar against the receipt of salary for Government work from a private source, does not apply to special Government employees. As appears below, there are a number of exceptions to the prohibitions summarized in the two lists. Comparison of Old and New Conflict of Interest Sections of Title 18, United States Code New 18 U.S.C. 203 . Subsection (a) of this section in general prohibits a Member of Congress and an officer or employee of the United States in any branch or agency of the Government from soliciting or receiving compensation for services rendered on behalf of another person before a Government department or agency in relation to any particular matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest. The subsection does not preclude compensation for services rendered on behalf of another in court. Subsection (a) is essentially a rewrite of the repealed portion of 18 U.S.C. 281 . However, subsections (b) and (c) have no counterparts in the previous statutes. Subsection (b) makes it unlawful for anyone to offer or pay compensation the solicitation or receipt of which is barred by subsection (a). Subsection (c) narrows the application of subsection (a) in the case of a person serving as a special Government employee to two, and only two, situations. First, subsection (c) bars him from rendering services before the Government on behalf of others, for compensation, in relation to a matter involving a specific party or parties in which he has participated personally and substantially in the course of his Government duties. And second, it bars him from such activities in relation to a matter involving a specific party or parties, even though he has not participated in the matter personally and substantially, if it is pending in his department or agency and he has served therein more than 60 days in the immediately preceding period of a year. New 18 U.S.C. 205 . This section contains two major prohibitions. The first prevents an officer or employee of the United States in any branch or agency of the Government from acting as agent or attorney for prosecuting any claim against the United States, including a claim in court, whether for compensation or not. It also prevents him from receiving a gratuity, or a share or interest in any such claim, for assistance in the prosecution thereof. This portion of section 205 is similar to the repealed portion of 18 U.S.C. 283, which dealt only with claims against the United States, but it omits a bar contained in the latter—i.e., a bar against rendering uncompensated aid or assistance in the prosecution or support of a claim against the United States. The second main prohibition of section 205 is concerned with more than claims. It precludes an officer or employee of the Government from acting as agent or attorney for anyone else before a department, agency or court in connection with any particular matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest. Section 205 provides for the same limited application to a special Government employee as section 203. In short, it precludes him from acting as agent or attorney only (1) in a matter involving a specific party or parties in which he has participated personally and substantially in his governmental capacity, and (2) in a matter involving a specific party or parties which is before his department or agency, if he has served therein more than 60 days in the year past. Since new sections 203 and 205 extend to activities in the same range of matters, they overlap to a greater extent than did their predecessor sections 281 and 283. The following are the few important differences between sections 203 and 205: 1. Section 203 applies to Members of Congress as well as officers and employees of the Government; section 205 applies only to the latter. 2. Section 203 bars services rendered for compensation solicited or received, but not those rendered without such compensation; section 205 bars both kinds of services. 3. Section 203 bars services rendered before the departments and agencies but not services rendered in court; section 205 bars both. It will be seen that while section 203 is controlling as to Members of Congress, for all practical purposes section 205 completely overshadows section 203 in respect of officers and employees of the Government. Section 205 permits a Government officer or employee to represent another person, without compensation, in a disciplinary, loyalty or other personnel matter. Another provision declares that the section does not prevent an officer or employee from giving testimony under oath or making statements required to be made under penalty for perjury or contempt. 5 Section 205 also authorizes a limited waiver of its restrictions and those of section 203 for the benefit of an officer or employee, including a special Government employee, who represents his own parents, spouse or child, or a person or estate he serves as a fiduciary. The waiver is available to the officer or employee, whether acting for any such person with or without compensation, but only if approved by the official making appointments to his position. And in no event does the waiver extend to his representation of any such person in matters in which he has participated personally and substantially or which, even in the absence of such participation, are the subject of his official responsibility. Finally, section 205 gives the head of a department or agency the power, notwithstanding any applicable restrictions in its provisions or those of section 203, to allow a special Government employee to represent his regular employer or other outside organization in the performance of work under a Government grant or contract. However, this action is open to the department or agency head only upon his certification, published in the Federal Register, that the national interest requires it. New 18 U.S.C. 207 . Subsections (a) and (b) of this section contain post-employment prohibitions applicable to persons who have ended service as officers or employees of the executive branch, the independent agencies or the District of Columbia. 6 The prohibitions for persons who have served as special Government employees are the same as for persons who have performed regular duties. The restraint of subsection (a) is against a former officer or employee's acting as agent or attorney for anyone other than the United States in connection with certain matters, whether pending in the courts or elsewhere. The matters are those involving a specific party or parties in which the United States is one of the parties or has a direct and substantial interest and in which the former officer or employee participated personally and substantially while holding a Government position. Subsection (b) sets forth a 1-year postemployment prohibition in respect of those matters which were within the area of official responsibility of a former officer or employee at any time during the last year of his service but which do not come within subsection (a) because he did not participate in them personally and substantially. More particularly, the prohibition of subsection (b) prevents his personal appearance in such matters before a court or a department or agency of the Government as agent or attorney for anyone other than the United States. 7 Where, in the year prior to the end of his service, a former officer or employee has changed areas of responsibility by transferring from one agency to another, the period of his postemployment ineligibility as to matters in a particular area ends 1 year after his responsibility for that area ends. For example, if an individual transfers from a supervisory position in the Internal Revenue Service to a supervisory position in the Post Office Department and leaves that department for private employment 9 months later, he will be free of the restriction of subsection (b) in 3 months insofar as Internal Revenue matters are concerned. He will of course be bound by it for a year in respect of Post Office Department matters. The proviso following subsections (a) and (b) authorizes an agency head, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in their provisions, to permit a former officer or employee with outstanding scientific qualifications to act as attorney or agent or appear personally before the agency for another in a matter in a scientific field. This authority may be exercised by the agency head upon a "national interest" certification published in the Federal Register. Subsections (a) and (b) describe the activities they forbid as being in connection with "particular matter[s] involving a specific party or parties" in which the former officer or employee had participated. The quoted language does not include general rulemaking, the formulation of general policy or standards, or other similar matters. Thus, past participation in or official responsibility for a matter of this kind on behalf of the Government does not disqualify a former employee from representing another person in a proceeding which is governed by the rule or other result of such matter. Subsection (a) bars permanently a greater variety of actions than subsection (b) bars temporarily. The conduct made unlawful by the former is any action as agent or attorney , while that made unlawful by the latter is a personal appearance as agent or attorney . However, neither subsection precludes postemployment activities which may fairly be characterized as no more than aiding or assisting another. 8 An individual who has left an agency to accept private employment may, for example, immediately perform technical work in his company's plant in relation to a contract for which he had official responsibility—or, for that matter, in relation to one he helped the agency negotiate. On the other hand, he is forbidden for a year, in the first case, to appear personally before the agency as the agent or attorney of his company in connection with a dispute over the terms of the contract. And he may at no time appear personally before the agency or otherwise act as agent or attorney for his company in such dispute if he helped negotiate the contract. Comparing subsection (a) with the antecedent 18 U.S.C. 284 discloses that it follows the latter in limiting disqualification to cases where a former officer or employee actually participated in a matter for the Government. However, subsection (a) covers all matters in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest and not merely the "claims against the United States" covered by 18 U.S.C. 284 . Subsection (a) also goes further than the latter in imposing a lifetime instead of a 2-year bar. Subsection (b) has no parallel in 18 U.S.C. 284 or any other provision of the former conflict of interest statutes. It will be seen that subsections (a) and (b) in combination are less restrictive in some respects, and more restrictive in others, than the combination of the prior 18 U.S.C. 284 and 5 U.S.C. 99 . Thus, former officers or employees who were outside the Government when the Act came into force on January 21, 1963, will in certain situations be enabled to carry on activities before the Government which were previously barred. For example, the repeal of 5 U.S.C. 99 permits an attorney who left an executive department for private practice a year before to take certain cases against the Government immediately which would be subject to the bar of 5 U.S.C. 99 for another year. On the other hand, former officers or employees became precluded on and after January 21, 1963 from engaging or continuing to engage in certain activities which were permissible until that date. This result follows from the replacement of the 2-year bar of 18 U.S.C. 284 with a lifetime bar of subsection (a) in comparable situations, from the increase in the variety of matters covered by subsection (a) as compared with 18 U.S.C. 284 and from the introduction of the 1-year bar of subsection (b). Subsection (c) of section 207 pertains to an individual outside the Government who is in a business or professional partnership with someone serving in the executive branch, an independent agency or the District of Columbia. The subsection prevents such individual from acting as attorney or agent for anyone other than the United States in any matter, including those in court, in which his partner in the Government is participating or has participated or which are the subject of his partner's official responsibility. Although included in a section dealing largely with post-employment activities, this provision is not directed to the postemployment situation. The paragraph at the end of section 207 also pertains to individuals in a partnership but sets forth no prohibition. This paragraph, which is of importance mainly to lawyers in private practice, rules out the possibility that an individual will be deemed subject to section 203, 205, 207(a) or 207(b) solely because he has a partner who serves or has served in the Government either as a regular or a special Government employee. New 18 U.S.C. 208 . This section forbids certain actions by an officer or employee of the Government in his role as a servant or representative of the Government. Its thrust is therefore to be distinguished from that of sections 203 and 205 which forbid certain actions in his capacity as a representative of persons outside the Government. Subsection (a) in substance requires an officer or employee of the executive branch, an independent agency or the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, to refrain from participating as such in any matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child or partner has a financial interest. He must also remove himself from a matter in which a business or nonprofit organization with which he is connected or is seeking employment has a financial interest. Subsection (b) permits the agency of an officer or employee to grant him an ad hoc exemption from subsection (a) if the outside financial interest in a matter is deemed not substantial enough to have an effect on the integrity of his services. Financial interests of this kind may also be made nondisqualifying by a general regulation published in the Federal Register. Section 208 is similar in purpose to the former 18 U.S.C. 434 but prohibits a greater variety of conduct than the "transaction of business with * * * [a] business entity" to which the prohibition of section 434 was limited. In addition, the provision in section 208 including the interests of a spouse and others is new, as is the provision authorizing exemptions for insignificant interest. New 18 U.S.C. 209 . Subsection (a) prevents an officer or employee of the executive branch, an independent agency or the District of Columbia from receiving, and anyone from paying him, any salary or supplementation of salary from a private source as compensation for his services to the Government. This provision uses much of the language of the former 18 U.S.C. 1914 and does not vary from that statute in substance. The remainder of section 209 is new. Subsection (b) specifically authorizes an officer or employee covered by subsection (a) to continue his participation in a bona fide pension plan or other employee welfare or benefit plan maintained by a former employer. Subsection (c) provides that section 209 does not apply to a special Government employee or to anyone serving the Government without compensation whether or not he is a special Government employee. Subsection (d) provides that the section does not prohibit the payment or acceptance of contributions, awards or other expenses under the terms of the Government Employees Training Act. ( 72 Stat. 327 , 5 U.S.C. 2301–2319 ). Statutory Exemptions From Conflict of Interest Laws Congress has in the past enacted statutes exempting persons in certain positions—usually advisory in nature—from the provisions of some or all of the former conflict of interest laws. Section 2 of the Act grants corresponding exemptions from the new laws with respect to legislative and judicial positions carrying such past exemptions. However, section 2 excludes positions in the executive branch, an independent agency and the District of Columbia from this grant. As a consequence, all statutory exemptions for persons serving in these sectors of the Government ended on January 21, 1963. Retired Officers of the Armed Forces Public Law 87–849 enacted a new 18 U.S.C. 206 which provides in general that the new sections 203 and 205, replacing 18 U.S.C. 281 and 283, do not apply to retired officers of the armed forces and other uniformed services. However, 18 U.S.C. 281 and 283 contain special restrictions applicable to retired officers of the armed forces which are left in force by the partial repealer of those statutes set forth in section 2 of the Act. The former 18 U.S.C. 284, which contained a 2-year disqualification against postemployment activities in connection with claims against the United States, applied by its terms to persons who had served as commissioned officers and whose active service had ceased either by reason of retirement or complete separation. Its replacement, the broader 18 U.S.C. 207, also applies to persons in those circumstances. Section 207, therefore applies to retired officers of the armed forces and overlaps the continuing provisions of 18 U.S.C. 281 and 283 applicable to such officers although to a different extent than did 18 U.S.C. 284 . Voiding Transactions in Violation of the Conflict of Interest or Bribery Laws Public Law 87–849 enacted a new section, 18 U.S.C. 218, which did not supplant a pre-existing section of the criminal code. However, it was modeled on the last sentence of the former 18 U.S.C. 216 authorizing the President to declare a Government contract void which was entered into in violation of that section. It will be recalled that section 216 was one of the two statutes repealed without replacement. The new 18 U.S.C. 218 grants the President and, under Presidential regulations, an agency head the power to void and rescind any transaction or matter in relation to which there has been a "final conviction" for a violation of the conflict of interest or bribery laws. The section also authorizes the Government's recovery, in addition to any penalty prescribed by law or in a contract, of the amount expended or thing transferred on behalf of the Government. Section 218 specifically provides that the powers it grants are "in addition to any other remedies provided by law." Accordingly, it would not seem to override the decision in United States v. Mississippi Valley Generating Co ., 364 U.S. 520 (1961), a case in which there was no "final conviction."

Footnotes 1 Section 190 of the Revised Statutes ( 5 U.S.C. 99 ), which was repealed by section 3 of Public Law 87–849, applied to a former officer or employee of the Government who had served in a department of the executive branch. It prohibited him, for a period of two years after his employment had ceased, from representing anyone in the prosecution of a claim against the United States which was pending in that or any other executive department during his period of employment. The subject of post-employment activities of former Government officers and employees was also dealt with in another statute which was repealed, 18 U.S.C. 284 . Public Law 87–849 covers the subject in a single section enacted as the new 18 U.S.C. 207 . 18 U.S.C. 216, which was repealed by section 1(c) of Public Law 87–849, prohibited the payment to or acceptance by a Member of Congress or officer or employee of the Government of any money or thing of value for giving or procuring a Government contract. Since this offense is within the scope of the newly enacted 18 U.S.C. 201 and 18 U.S.C. 203, relating to bribery and conflicts of interest, respectively, section 216 is no longer necessary. 2 See section 2 of Public Law 87–849 . 18 U.S.C. 281 and 18 U.S.C. 283 were not completely set aside by section 2 but remain in effect to the extent that they apply to retired officers of the Armed Forces (see "Retired Officers of the Armed Forces," infra ). 3 S. Rept. 2213, 87th Cong., 2d sess., p. 6. 4 The term "official responsibility" is defined by the new 18 U.S.C. 202(b) to mean "the direct administrative or operating authority, whether intermediate or final, and either exercisable alone or with others, and either personally or through subordinates, to approve, disapprove, or otherwise direct Government action." 5 These two provisions of section 205 refer to an "officer or employee" and not, as do certain of the other provisions of the Act, to an "officer or employee, including a special Government employee." However, it is plain from the definition in section 202(a) that a special Government employee is embraced within the comprehensive term "officer or employee." There would seem to be little doubt, therefore, that the instant provisions of section 205 apply to special Government employees even in the absence of an explicit reference to them. 6 The prohibitions of the two subsections apply to persons ending service in these areas whether they leave the Government entirely or move to the legislative or judicial branch. As a practical matter, however, the prohibitions would rarely be significant in the latter situation because officers and employees of the legislative and judicial branches are covered by sections 203 and 205. 7 Neither section 203 nor section 205 prevents a special Government employee, during his period of affiliation with the Government, from representing another person before the Government in a particular matter only because it is within his official responsibility. Therefore the inclusion of a former special Government employee within the 1-year postemployment ban of subsection (b) may subject him to a temporary restraint from which he was free prior to the end of his Government service. However, since special Government employees usually do not have "official responsibility," as that term is defined in section 202(b), their inclusion within the 1-year ban will not have a widespread effect. 8 Subsection (a), as it first appeared in H.R. 8140, the bill which became Public Law 87–849, made it unlawful for a former officer or employee to act as agent or attorney for, or aid or assist , anyone in a matter in which he had participated. The House Judiciary Committee struck the underlined words, and the bill became law without them. It should be noted also that the repealed provisions of 18 U.S.C. 283 made the distinction between one's acting as agent or attorney for another and his aiding or assisting another. §202. Definitions (a) For the purpose of sections 203, 205, 207, 208, and 209 of this title the term "special Government employee" shall mean an officer or employee of the executive or legislative branch of the United States Government, of any independent agency of the United States or of the District of Columbia, who is retained, designated, appointed, or employed to perform, with or without compensation, for not to exceed one hundred and thirty days during any period of three hundred and sixty-five consecutive days, temporary duties either on a full-time or intermittent basis, a part-time United States commissioner, a part-time United States magistrate judge, or, regardless of the number of days of appointment, an independent counsel appointed under chapter 40 of title 28 and any person appointed by that independent counsel under section 594(c) of title 28 . Notwithstanding the next preceding sentence, every person serving as a part-time local representative of a Member of Congress in the Member's home district or State shall be classified as a special Government employee. Notwithstanding section 29(c) and (d) 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956 ( 70A Stat. 632 ; 5 U.S.C. 30r(c) and (d)), a Reserve officer of the Armed Forces, or an officer of the National Guard of the United States, unless otherwise an officer or employee of the United States, shall be classified as a special Government employee while on active duty solely for training. A Reserve officer of the Armed Forces or an officer of the National Guard of the United States who is voluntarily serving a period of extended active duty in excess of one hundred and thirty days shall be classified as an officer of the United States within the meaning of section 203 and sections 205 through 209 and 218. A Reserve officer of the Armed Forces or an officer of the National Guard of the United States who is serving involuntarily shall be classified as a special Government employee. The terms "officer or employee" and "special Government employee" as used in sections 203, 205, 207 through 209, and 218, shall not include enlisted members of the Armed Forces. (b) For the purposes of sections 205 and 207 of this title , the term "official responsibility" means the direct administrative or operating authority, whether intermediate or final, and either exercisable alone or with others, and either personally or through subordinates, to approve, disapprove, or otherwise direct Government action. (c) Except as otherwise provided in such sections, the terms "officer" and "employee" in sections 203, 205, 207 through 209, and 218 of this title shall not include the President, the Vice President, a Member of Congress, or a Federal judge. (d) The term "Member of Congress" in sections 204 and 207 means— (1) a United States Senator; and (2) a Representative in, or a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the House of Representatives. (e) As used in this chapter, the term— (1) "executive branch" includes each executive agency as defined in title 5, and any other entity or administrative unit in the executive branch; (2) "judicial branch" means the Supreme Court of the United States; the United States courts of appeals; the United States district courts; the Court of International Trade; the United States bankruptcy courts; any court created pursuant to article I of the United States Constitution, including the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the United States Tax Court, but not including a court of a territory or possession of the United States; the Federal Judicial Center; and any other agency, office, or entity in the judicial branch; and (3) "legislative branch" means— (A) the Congress; and (B) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the United States Botanic Garden, the Government Accountability Office, the Government Publishing Office, the Library of Congress, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Congressional Budget Office, the United States Capitol Police, and any other agency, entity, office, or commission established in the legislative branch.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §51 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §19, 35 Stat. 1092 ). Clause making conspirator ineligible to hold office was omitted as incongruous because it attaches ineligibility to hold office to a person who may be a private citizen and who was convicted of conspiracy to violate a specific statute. There seems to be no reason for imposing such a penalty in the case of one individual crime, in view of the fact that other crimes do not carry such a severe consequence. The experience of the Department of Justice is that this unusual penalty has been an obstacle to successful prosecutions for violations of the act. Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative. Minor changes in phraseology were made. Editorial Notes Amendments 1996 — Pub. L. 104–294, §607(a), substituted "any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District" for "any State, Territory, or District" in first par. Pub. L. 104–294, §604(b)(14)(A), repealed Pub.

Pub. L. 103–322, §320103(a)(1), which provided for amendment identical to Pub. L. 103–322, §330016(1)(L), above, was repealed by Pub. L. 104–294, §604(b)(14)(A). Pub. L. 103–322, §60006(a), substituted ", or may be sentenced to death." for period at end of third par. 1988 — Pub.

Words "or bounty land", before "prosecution of any claim for pension", were omitted as obsolete. (See reviser's note under section 290 of this title .) Upon authority of 1930 enactment words "Administrator of Veterans' Affairs" were substituted for "Commissioner of Pensions or of the Secretary of the Interior", which appeared in 1898 enactment. The fine was changed from "$500" for "$10,000" to conform with punishment provision of section 287 of this title . Minor changes in phraseology were also made. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000". 1991 — Pub. L. 102–54 substituted "Secretary of Veterans Affairs" for "Administrator of Veterans' Affairs". §290.

Words "and shall upon conviction, be" were omitted as surplusage since punishment can follow only after conviction. To clarify meaning of "executive department" word "executive" before "department" was deleted and words "or agency" were inserted after it. (See definitions of "department" and "agency" in section 6 of this title .) Words "bounty", before "pension", and "or land warrant", before "of any such soldier", were deleted as obsolete. According to regulations, Circular 1151, January 8, 1929, issued by the Secretary of the Interior and the General Land Office (see 43 CFR 131.1–131.2) "warrants for bounty lands were and are issued by the Commissioner of Pensions (Administrator of Veterans' Affairs) for services in wars or battles prior to March 3, 1855 only." Further, it is stated that "Warrants can not now be 'located' upon the public lands. The locating privilege was denied except in the state of Missouri after the passage of the act of March 2, 1889 ( 25 Stat. 854 ; 43 U.S.C. §700), and there are no lands known to the General Land Office to be subject to warrant location in Missouri." Words "and honorably discharged" were omitted as unnecessary and words "or for his dependents or beneficiaries" were inserted after "United States" so as to embrace an important class of persons who employ attorneys or agents in the collection of claims permitted by statute. Minor changes of phraseology were also made. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $500". §291.

L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000". Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Change of Name Words "magistrate judge" substituted for "magistrate" in text pursuant to section 321 of Pub. L. 101–650, set out as a note under section 631 of Title 28 , Judiciary and Judicial Procedure. Previously, "magistrate" substituted for "commissioner" pursuant to Pub. L. 90–578 .

The words "under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5 " are substituted for "under this Act" (Federal Employees' Compensation Act) to reflect the codification of the Act in title 5, United States Code . The words "is approved by the Secretary of Labor" are substituted for "is so approved". The words "Secretary of Labor" are substituted for "Administrator" (Federal Security Administrator) on authority of 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 19, §1, eff. May 24, 1950, 64 Stat. 1271 .

The words "and upon conviction thereof" are omitted as unnecessary because punishment can be imposed only after conviction. The words "or both" are substituted for "or by both such fine and imprisonment". Minor changes in phraseology are made to conform to the style of title 18. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub.

Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . Changes were also made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub.

( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 700 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §280 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §166, 35 Stat. 1120 ). Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000". §333. Mutilation of national bank obligations Whoever mutilates, cuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates, or unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, or Federal Reserve bank, or the Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt unfit to be reissued, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 700 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(B), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2146 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §291 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §176, 35 Stat. 1122 ). Words "or Federal Reserve bank, or the Federal Reserve System" were inserted because the paper of such banks has almost supplanted national bank currency. Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . Minor changes in phraseology were made. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $100". §334. Issuance of Federal Reserve or national bank notes Whoever, being a Federal Reserve Agent, or an agent or employee of such Federal Reserve Agent, or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, issues or puts in circulation any Federal Reserve notes, without complying with or in violation of the provisions of law regulating the issuance and circulation of such Federal Reserve notes; or Whoever, being an officer acting under the provisions of chapter 2 of Title 12 , countersigns or delivers to any national banking association, or to any other company or person, any circulating notes contemplated by that chapter except in strict accordance with its provisions— Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 581 and 592 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. §§5187, 5209; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, §7, 40 Stat. 972 ; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §316, 49 Stat. 712 ). This section consolidates section 581 and part of section 592 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking. The punishment provision was drawn from said section 592 as being the latest expression of congressional intent, in preference to the provision of said section 581 which authorized a fine "not more than double the amount so countersigned and delivered and imprisonment not more than 15 years". The words "shall be guilty of a misdemeanor" were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title . Likewise the words "upon conviction in any district court of the United States" were omitted as unnecessary since punishment can follow only after conviction. (See reviser's note under section 656 of this title for statement of reasons for dividing said section 592 into three revised sections, with consequent changes in phraseology, style, and arrangement.) Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000". §335. Circulation of obligations of expired corporations Whoever, being a director, officer, or agent of a corporation created by Act of Congress, the charter of which has expired, or trustee thereof, or an agent of such trustee, or a person having in his possession or under his control the property of such corporation for the purpose of paying or redeeming its notes and obligations, knowingly issues, reissues, or utters as money, or in any other way knowingly puts in circulation any bill, note, check, draft, or other security purporting to have been made by any such corporation, or by any officer thereof, or purporting to have been made under authority derived therefrom, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 700 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §289 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §174, 35 Stat. 1122 ). The reference to persons aiding was omitted as unnecessary, since such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title . The last sentence excepting bona fide holders in due course was omitted as surplusage. Other changes in phraseology also were made. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000". §336. Issuance of circulating obligations of less than $1 Whoever makes, issues, circulates, or pays out any note, check, memorandum, token, or other obligation for a less sum than $1, intended to circulate as money or to be received or used in lieu of lawful money of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 701 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §293 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §178, 35 Stat. 1122 ). Numerous suggestions, of which that of Mr. E. M. Million, of Arlington, Va., is typical, recommend that this section be omitted as obsolete or revised to except commercial obligations. However, since the decisions make it plain that only obligations intended to circulate as money are within the provisions of this section and that commercial checks of less than $1 are not affected, there seems no reason so to rewrite the section. (See U.S. v. Monongahela Bridge Co ., Fed. Cas. No. 15,796; Stettinius v. U.S ., Fed. Cas. No. 13,387.) Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $500". §337. Coins as security for loans Whoever lends or borrows money or credit upon the security of such coins of the United States as the Secretary of the Treasury may from time to time designate by proclamation published in the Federal Register, during any period designated in such a proclamation, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330021(1), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2150 , substituted "kidnapping" for "kidnaping" in item 351. 1982 — Pub.

CHAPTER 19 —CONSPIRACY Sec. 371. Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States. 372. Conspiracy to impede or injure officer. 373. Solicitation to commit a crime of violence. Editorial Notes Amendments 1984 — Pub. L. 98–473, title II, §1003(b), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2138 , added item 373. §371. Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. If, however, the offense, the commission of which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor only, the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 701 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§88, 294 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §37, 35 Stat. 1096 ; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §178a, as added Sept. 27, 1944, ch. 425, 58 Stat. 752 ). This section consolidates said sections 88 and 294 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. To reflect the construction placed upon said section 88 by the courts the words "or any agency thereof" were inserted. (See Haas v. Henkel , 1909, 30 S. Ct. 249, 216 U. S. 462, 54 L. Ed. 569, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112, where court said: "The statute is broad enough in its terms to include any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful functions of any department of government." Also, see United States v. Walter , 1923, 44 S. Ct. 10, 263 U. S. 15, 68 L. Ed. 137, and definitions of department and agency in section 6 of this title .) The punishment provision is completely rewritten to increase the penalty from 2 years to 5 years except where the object of the conspiracy is a misdemeanor. If the object is a misdemeanor, the maximum imprisonment for a conspiracy to commit that offense, under the revised section, cannot exceed 1 year. The injustice of permitting a felony punishment on conviction for conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is described by the late Hon. Grover M. Moscowitz, United States district judge for the eastern district of New York, in an address delivered March 14, 1944, before the section on Federal Practice of the New York Bar Association, reported in 3 Federal Rules Decisions, pages 380–392. Hon. John Paul, United States district judge for the western district of Virginia, in a letter addressed to Congressman Eugene J. Keogh dated January 27, 1944, stresses the inadequacy of the 2-year sentence prescribed by existing law in cases where the object of the conspiracy is the commission of a very serious offense. The punishment provision of said section 294 of title 18 was considered for inclusion in this revised section. It provided the same penalties for conspiracy to violate the provisions of certain counterfeiting laws, as are applicable in the case of conviction for the specific violations. Such a punishment would seem as desirable for all conspiracies as for such offenses as counterfeiting and transporting stolen property in interstate commerce. A multiplicity of unnecessary enactments inevitably leads to confusion and disregard of law. (See reviser's note under section 493 of this title .) Since consolidation was highly desirable and because of the strong objections of prosecutors to the general application of the punishment provision of said section 294, the revised section represents the best compromise that could be devised between sharply conflicting views. A number of special conspiracy provisions, relating to specific offenses, which were contained in various sections incorporated in this title, were omitted because adequately covered by this section. A few exceptions were made, (1) where the conspiracy would constitute the only offense, or (2) where the punishment provided in this section would not be commensurate with the gravity of the offense. Special conspiracy provisions were retained in sections 241, 286, 372, 757, 794, 956, 1201, 2271, 2384 and 2388 of this title . Special conspiracy provisions were added to sections 2153 and 2154 of this title . Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000". §372. Conspiracy to impede or injure officer If two or more persons in any State, Territory, Possession, or District conspire to prevent, by force, intimidation, or threat, any person from accepting or holding any office, trust, or place of confidence under the United States, or from discharging any duties thereof, or to induce by like means any officer of the United States to leave the place, where his duties as an officer are required to be performed, or to injure him in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office, or while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof, or to injure his property so as to molest, interrupt, hinder, or impede him in the discharge of his official duties, each of such persons shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six years, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 701 ; Pub. L. 107–273, div. B, title IV, §4002(d)(1)(D), Nov. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 1809 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §54 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §21, 35 Stat. 1092 ). Scope of section was enlarged to cover all possessions of the United States. When the section was first enacted in 1861 there were no possessions, and hence the use of the words "State or Territory" was sufficient to describe the area then subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The word "District" was inserted by the codifiers of the 1909 Criminal Code. Editorial Notes Amendments 2002 — Pub. L. 107–273 substituted "under this title" for "not more than $5,000". §373. Solicitation to commit a crime of violence (a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against property or against the person of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavors to persuade such other person to engage in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty years. (b) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defense at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. (c) It is not a defense to a prosecution under this section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution. (Added Pub. L. 98–473, title II, §1003(a), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2138 ; amended Pub. L. 99–646, §26, Nov. 10, 1986, 100 Stat. 3597 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(2)(A), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148 .) Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 103–322 inserted "(notwithstanding section 3571)" before "fined not more than one-half". 1986 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 99–646 substituted "property or against the person of another" for "the person or property of another" and inserted "life imprisonment or" before "death". CHAPTER 21 —CONTEMPTS Sec. 401. Power of court. 402. Contempts constituting crimes. 403. Protection of the privacy of child victims and child witnesses. Editorial Notes Amendments 1990 — Pub. L. 101–647, title II, §225(b)(2), Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 4806 , added item 403. 1949 —Act May 24, 1949, ch. 139, §8(a), (b), 63 Stat. 90 , struck out "CONSTITUTING CRIMES" in chapter heading and substituted "Contempts constituting crimes" for "Criminal contempts" in item 402. §401. Power of court A court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, or both, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as— (1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice; (2) Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions; (3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 701 ; Pub. L. 107–273, div. B, title III, §3002(a)(1), Nov. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 1805 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 385 of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary ( Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §268, 36 Stat. 1163 ). Said section 385 conferred two powers. The first part authorizing courts of the United States to impose and administer oaths will remain in title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary. The second part relating to contempt of court constitutes this section. Changes in phraseology and arrangement were made. Editorial Notes Amendments 2002 — Pub. L. 107–273 inserted "or both," after "fine or imprisonment," in introductory provisions. §402. Contempts constituting crimes Any person, corporation or association willfully disobeying any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of any district court of the United States, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review established by section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ( 50 U.S.C. 1803 ), or any court of the District of Columbia, by doing any act or thing therein, or thereby forbidden, if the act or thing so done be of such character as to constitute also a criminal offense under any statute of the United States or under the laws of any State in which the act was committed, shall be prosecuted for such contempt as provided in section 3691 of this title and shall be punished by a fine under this title or imprisonment, or both. Such fine shall be paid to the United States or to the complainant or other party injured by the act constituting the contempt, or may, where more than one is so damaged, be divided or apportioned among them as the court may direct, but in no case shall the fine to be paid to the United States exceed, in case the accused is a natural person, the sum of $1,000, nor shall such imprisonment exceed the term of six months. This section shall not be construed to relate to contempts committed in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, nor to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States, but the same, and all other cases of contempt not specifically embraced in this section may be punished in conformity to the prevailing usages at law. For purposes of this section, the term "State" includes a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 701 ; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, §8(c), 63 Stat. 90 ; Pub. L. 101–647, title XII, §1205(c), Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 4830 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §§330011(f), 330016(2)(E), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2145 , 2148 ; Pub. L. 118–49, §14(a), Apr. 20, 2024, 138 Stat. 882 .) Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on sections 386, 387, 389, and 390a of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary ( Oct. 15, 1914, ch. 323, §§1, 21, 22, 24, 38 Stat. 730 , 738 , 739 ). Section 21 of the Clayton Act, section 386 of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, is here consolidated with parts of sections 1, 22, and 24 of the same act. Section 1 of said act, section 390a of title 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, defined person or persons. Section 22 of said act, section 387 of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, regulated the procedure and provided for the punishment of contempts. Section 24 of said act, section 389 of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, limited the application of these sections to certain kinds of contempt. In transferring these sections to this title and in consolidating them numerous changes of phraseology were necessary which do not, however, change their meaning or substance. Words "corporation or association" were inserted after "any person" in substitution for the definition provisions of section 390a of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, which read as follows: "The word 'person' or 'persons' wherever used in sections 381–383, 386–390a of this title , sections 12, 13, 14–19, 20, 21, 22–27 and 44 of title 15 , and section 412 of title 18 shall be deemed to include corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the Territories, the laws of any State, or the laws of any foreign country." The words "any person, corporation, or association," unqualified except by the context of the section mean all that the more lengthy definition included. Only those persons, corporations, and associations who were parties to the order or had actual notice of it may be punished for contempt. (See McCauly v. First Trust & Savings Bank , C.C.A. Ill. 1921, 276 F. 117. See, also National Labor Relations Board v. Blackstone Mfg. Co ., C.C.A. 1941, 123 F. 2d 633.) The fact that the contemnor was incorporated or organized under a foreign law or under the laws of a particular State or Territory would hardly be relevant to the issue of criminal contempt. As noted above these sections were part of the Clayton Act, entitled "An act to supplement existing laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other purposes." Whatever doubt might have existed as to whether the contempt provisions were variously limited to antitrust cases seems to be dispelled by the case of Sandefur v. Canoe Creek Coal Co . (C.C.A. Ky. 1923, 293 F. 379, certified question answered 45 S. Ct. 18, 266 U.S. 42, 69 L. Ed. 162, 35 A.L.R. 451), where the court says: "The act, considered as a whole, covers several more or less distinct subjects. * * * The first eight sections pertain directly to the subject of trust and monopolies; section 9 concerns interstate commerce; section 10, combinations among common carriers; section 11, proceedings to enforce certain provisions of the act; sections 12–16, antitrust procedure and remedies; sections 17–19, regulations of injunction and restraining orders in all cases; section 20 limits the power of an equity court to issue any injunction in a certain class of cases, viz., between employer and the employee; and sections 21–24 pertain to procedure in any district court, punishing contemptuous disregard of any order of such court, providing the act constituting contempt is also a criminal offense. Observing this relation of the various parts of the act to each other, we think 'within the purview of this act' must refer to that portion of the act which most broadly covers the subject-matter to which section 22 is devoted, and this portion is section 21, which reaches all cases where the act of contempt is also a criminal offense. We know of nothing in the legislative history of the act, or within the common knowledge as to the then existing situation, which justifies us in thinking that 'within the purview of this act,' in section 22, meant to limit its effect to the employer-employee provisions of section 20, or even to the antitrust scope of some of the earlier sections." (See also Michaelson v. United States , 1924, 45 S. Ct. 18, 166 U.S. 42, 69 L. Ed. 162, 35 A.L.R. 451, and H. Rept. No. 613, 62d Cong., 2d sess., to accompany H.R. 15657.) 1949 Act This amendment [see section 8] corrects the catchline of section 402 of title 18 , U.S.C., to better represent the section content. Editorial Notes Amendments 2024 — Pub. L. 118–49 inserted ", including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review established by section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ( 50 U.S.C. 1803 )," after "any district court of the United States" in first par. 1994 — Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §205 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §115, 35 Stat. 1109 ). Words "agency" and "employee" were inserted to eliminate any ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definition of agency under section 6 of this title .) Changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $3,000". §433. Exemptions with respect to certain contracts Sections 431 and 432 of this title shall not extend to any contract or agreement made or entered into, or accepted by any incorporated company for the general benefit of such corporation; nor to the purchase or sale of bills of exchange or other property where the same are ready for delivery and payment therefor is made at the time of making or entering into the contract or agreement. Nor shall the provisions of such sections apply to advances, loans, discounts, purchase or repurchase agreements, extensions, or renewals thereof, or acceptances, releases or substitutions of security therefor or other contracts or agreements made or entered into under the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Federal Farm Loan Act, the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act of 1933, the Farm Credit Act of 1933, or the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933, the Farmers' Home Administration Act of 1946, the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, or to crop insurance agreements or contracts or agreements of a kind which the Secretary of Agriculture may enter into with farmers. Any exemption permitted by this section shall be made a matter of public record. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 703 ; Pub. L. 87–353, §3(o), Oct. 4, 1961, 75 Stat. 774 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 1514(f) of title 7 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture; sections 264w, 598, 1138d(e), 1441(e), 1467(d) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking; section 616(e) of title 15 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade; title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §206 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §116, 35 Stat. 1109 ; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22(j), as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, §3, 48 Stat. 1107 ; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16(e), 47 Stat. 12 ; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21, 47 Stat. 738 ; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, §8, 48 Stat. 135 ; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64, 48 Stat. 268 , 269 ; Jan. 25, 1934, ch. 5, 48 Stat. 337 ; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, §13, 48 Stat. 347 ; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, title V, §510, 58 Stat. 1264 ; May 28, 1935, ch. 150, §§20, 21, 49 Stat. 298 ; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §101, 49 Stat. 703 ; Aug. 26, 1937, ch. 821, 50 Stat. 838 ; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, §514, 52 Stat. 77 ). These sections were consolidated with such changes of phraseology as were necessary to effect consolidation. Said section 206 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., was the principal source of this section, but the enumeration of the kinds of commitments exempted was drawn from the various sections of said title 12 set forth above. The reference to crop insurance agreements is drawn from section 1514(f) of Title 7 , Agriculture. The applicability provisions of the sections here consolidated were unclear and of doubtful value. As revised the section preserves everything of value without change of substance. References to the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act and the Farmers' Home Administrative Act of 1946 were included in this revised section notwithstanding the omission (and consequent repeal) of former subsection (d) of section 52 of the said Bankhead-Jones Act (1937) (Title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §1026) in the amendment of said section 52 of such Act by section 3 of the said Farmers' Home Administration Act of 1946 ( August 14, 1946, ch. 964, 60 Stat. 1062 ). The essential nature of the transactions under the several acts would render inconsistent any attempt to include some and exclude others.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §184 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §98, 35 Stat. 1106 ). Words "or employee" were inserted to remove any ambiguity as to scope of section. The offense described in this section involves no moral turpitude, and therefore the punishment provisions were reduced from $2,000 to $1,000 and from 2 years to 1 year, so that the stigma of a felony would not attach to an offender. (See classification of felony and misdemeanor in section 1 of this title and note thereunder.) Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative. Changes were also made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322, which directed the amendment of this section by substituting "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000", was executed by making the substitution for "fined not more than $1,000", to reflect the probable intent of Congress. 1 See 1994 Amendment note below. §436. Convict labor contracts Whoever, being an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or any department or agency thereof, contracts with any person or corporation, or permits any warden, agent, or official of any penal or correctional institution, to hire out the labor of any prisoners confined for violation of any laws of the United States, shall be fined under this title 1 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

This section consolidates sections 708 and 709 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., as the offense and penalty provisions, respectively. Words "department or agency thereof" were inserted to clarify scope of section. See definition of department and agency in section 6 of this title . To retain uniformity words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and," were omitted. The reference to misdemeanor is now covered by the definition in section 1 of this title . Words "on conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary since punishment can follow only upon conviction. The minimum punishment provisions "less than one year nor" and "less than $500 nor" were deleted to conform to the policy followed by codifiers of 1909 Criminal Code. (See reviser's note under section 203 of this title .) Changes were also made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322, which directed the amendment of this section by substituting "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000", was executed by making the substitution for "fined not more than $1,000", to reflect the probable intent of Congress. 1 See 1994 Amendment note below.

Minimum punishment provisions "less than $100 nor" and "less than three months nor" were omitted to conform to policy followed by codifiers of 1909 Criminal Code. Changes in phraseology were also made. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322, which directed the amendment of this section by substituting "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000", was executed by making the substitution for "fined not more than $5,000" in second par., to reflect the probable intent of Congress. 1970 — Pub.

Government Publishing Office (a) Definitions .—In this section— (1) the terms "diversified", "employee benefit plan", "holdings", "mutual fund", and "unit investment trust" have the meanings given those terms under section 2640.102 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto; and (2) the term "printing-related interest" means an interest, direct or indirect, in— (A) the publication of any newspaper or periodical; (B) any printing, binding, engraving, or lithographing of any kind; or (C) any contract for furnishing paper or other material connected with the public printing, binding, lithographing, or engraving. (b) Offense.— (1) In general .—Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Director of the Government Publishing Office, Deputy Director of the Government Publishing Office, nor 1 any of their assistants as determined by the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall not, 1 during his or her continuance in office, have any printing-related interest. (2) Exception for mutual funds, unit investment trusts, employee benefit plans, and retirement plans .—It shall not be a violation of paragraph (1) for an individual who is described in such paragraph to have an interest in a diversified mutual fund, diversified unit investment trust, employee benefit plan, investment fund under the Thrift Savings Plan under subchapter III of chapter 84 of title 5 , or pension plan established or maintained by a State government or any political subdivision of a State government for its employees that has 1 or more holdings that are printing-related interests if the fund, trust, or plan does not exhibit a practice of concentrating in printing-related interests.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 53 of title 44 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents ( Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23, §34, 28 Stat. 605 ). Words "on conviction before any court of competent jurisdiction" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until there has been a conviction before a competent tribunal. Words "in the penitentiary" were omitted as surplusage as section 4082 of this title commits all prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title .) The minimum punishment provision "for a term of not less than one nor" was omitted in keeping with policy of codifiers of 1909 Criminal Code. Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative. The offense described in this section involves no moral turpitude, and therefore the punishment provisions were reduced from 5 years to 1 year, so that the stigma of a felony would not attach to an offender. The fine was increased from $500 to $1,000 as more proportionate to the 1-year term of imprisonment. (See classification of felony and misdemeanor in section 1 of this title and note thereunder.) Editorial Notes References in Text The Ethics in Government Act of 1978, referred to in subsec. (b)(3), is Pub. L. 95–521, Oct. 26, 1978, 92 Stat. 1824 . Titles I, IV, and V of the Act were classified principally to the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, and were substantially repealed and restated in chapter 131 (§13101 et seq.) of Title 5 by Pub. L. 117–286, §§3(c), 7, Dec. 27, 2022, 136 Stat. 4266 , 4361 . For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables. For disposition of sections of the Act into chapter 131 of Title 5 , see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of Title 5 . Amendments 2019 — Pub. L. 116–78 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: "Neither the Public Printer, superintendent of printing, superintendent of binding, nor any of their assistants shall, during their continuance in office, have any interest, direct or indirect, in the publication of any newspaper or periodical, or in any printing, binding, engraving, or lithographing of any kind, or in any contract for furnishing paper or other material connected with the public printing, binding, lithographing, or engraving. "Whoever violates this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both." 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000" in second par. 1 So in original. 2 See References in Text note below. §443. War contracts Whoever willfully secretes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys— (a) any records of a war contractor relating to the negotiation, award, performance, payment, interim financing, cancellation or other termination, or settlement of a war contract of $25,000 or more; or (b) any records of a war contractor or purchaser relating to any disposition of termination inventory in which the consideration received by any war contractor or any government agency is $5,000 or more, before the lapse of (1) five years after such disposition of termination inventory by such war contractor or government agency, or (2) five years after the final settlement of such war contract, whichever applicable period is longer, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. The Administrator of General Services, by regulation, may authorize the destruction of such records upon such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate, including the requirement for the making and retaining of photographs or microphotographs, which shall have the same force and effect as the originals thereof. The definitions of terms in section 103 1 of Title 41 shall apply to similar terms used in this section. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 704 ; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 655, §20(a), 65 Stat. 717 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §§330004(17), 330016(2)(F), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2142 , 2148 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 119, first and second paragraphs, of title 41 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts ( July 1, 1944, ch. 358, §19(a), 58 Stat. 667 ). Section was rewritten with changes of phraseology to conform to the style adopted in the revision. The definition of "records" was omitted as surplusage in order to avoid any inference that "records" as used in other sections was intended to have a different or more limited connotation than the broad and commonly understood meaning popularly assigned to the term. The last paragraph was added to obviate any possibility of doubt as to meaning of terms defined in section 103 of Title 41 , Public Contracts. Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title .

Section was materially shortened through merger of former third and fourth sentences with present first and second paragraphs by extending latter to include "articles, devices, and other things". This necessitated many insertions and deletions in the first two paragraphs, which, however, did not affect the substance of the section. A reference in the former third sentence to violations of certain sections was broadened to read "in violation of this chapter or of sections 331–333, 335–336, 642, 1720, of this title " and incorporated in the first paragraph. This translation extends for the first time the provisions of this section to subject matter of sections 493–496, 498, 499, 504–509 of this title . All of the sections covered by the original reference in this section are represented in the translation except section 261, now section 8 of this title , and section 287 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were omitted therefrom as unnecessary, since the former is definitive and the latter related to procedure only, and is superseded by rule 41(a), (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The revised section was so written as to limit the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to forfeitures within the enforcement powers of the Treasury Department, which advises that it does not investigate counterfeiting offenses not involving coins, currency, or Government obligations and securities. The Attorney General is the appropriate officer to remit or mitigate other forfeitures. Changes in phraseology were also made. Editorial Notes Amendments 2002 — Pub. L. 107–273 substituted "under this title" for "not more than $100" in second par. §493. Bonds and obligations of certain lending agencies Whoever falsely makes, forges, counterfeits or alters any note, bond, debenture, coupon, obligation, instrument, or writing in imitation or purporting to be in imitation of, a note, bond, debenture, coupon, obligation, instrument or writing, issued by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Home Owners' Loan Corporation, Farm Credit Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development, or any land bank, intermediate credit bank, insured credit union, bank for cooperatives or any lending, mortgage, insurance, credit or savings and loan corporation or association authorized or acting under the laws of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both. Whoever passes, utters, or publishes, or attempts to pass, utter or publish any note, bond, debenture, coupon, obligation, instrument or document knowing the same to have been falsely made, forged, counterfeited or altered, contrary to the provisions of this section, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 264(t), 982, 1126, 1138d(b), 1316, 1441(b), 1467(b), 1731(b) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(b) of title 15 , U.S.C. 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §12B(t), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, §8, 48 Stat. 178 , and amended Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §101, 49 Stat. 684 ; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §31 (second paragraph), 39 Stat. 383 ; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §211(f), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title I, §2, 42 Stat. 1460 ; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, §216(f), 42 Stat. 1472 ; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16(b), 47 Stat. 11 ; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21(b), 47 Stat. 738 ; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, §8(b), 48 Stat. 134 ; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64(b), 48 Stat. 268 ; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, §512(b), 48 Stat. 1265 ). Each of the nine sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations. The punishment was the same in each section except that in sections 982, 1126, and 1316 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, the maximum fine was $5,000. This section adopts the $10,000 maximum fine provided in the other six former sections. This section condenses and simplifies the form of the former sections without change of substance, except where the maximum fine differs as noted above. The enumeration of "note, bond, debenture, coupon, obligation, instrument, or writing" does not occur in any one of the original sections but is an adequate enumeration of the instruments mentioned in each. Certain specific agencies are enumerated by name as are "land bank, intermediate credit bank, bank for cooperatives," but the phrase "or any lending, mortgage, insurance, credit, or savings and loan corporation or association" was used to embrace the following: National Farm Loan Association, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, Federal Savings and Loan Associations, National Agricultural Credit Corporation, Production Credit Corporations, Production Credit Associations, Home Loan Banks, National Mortgage Associations, and Central Bank for Cooperatives, Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, or any instrumentalities created for similar purposes. Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary, such persons being principals by section 2 of this title . The section was written in two paragraphs; the first denouncing forgery, counterfeiting, and altering; the second, passing, uttering, and publishing. This arrangement, together with the simplified style of the rewritten section, will permit the repeal of similar provisions in at least nine complicated sections now in title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking. Section 1138d(f) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, was omitted from this revision and recommended for repeal. It provides as follows: "Whoever conspires with another to accomplish any of the acts made unlawful by the preceding provisions of this section shall, on conviction thereof, be subject to the same fine or imprisonment, or both, as is applicable in the case of conviction for doing such unlawful act." The only case construing such subsection (f) is United States v. Halbrook , D.C. Mo. 1941, 36 F. Supp. 345, in which the District Judge said by way of obiter dictum in a footnote that "Under this section no overt act need be shown as is true in the case of a prosecution under section 37 of the Criminal Code", now section 371 of this title . Indeed the indictment upon which Halbrook was acquitted was drawn under section 88 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., now section 371 of this title , which required allegation and proof of an overt act and provided punishment by fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or both. The second indictment charged only substantive violations and involved neither conspiracy section. It will be noted that section 1138d(f) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, applies in terms only to the Farm Credit Administration, intermediate credit banks, Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, and by reference to the banks for cooperatives, Production Credit Associations and Production Credit Corporations, and is not applicable to land banks, loan associations, Federal Housing Administration, Home Owners' Loan Corporation, or other institutions. It is also noted that in the only reported case involving this section, the United States attorney drew his conspiracy indictment not under section 1138d(f) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, but under section 88 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., which is now section 371 of this title , indicating considerable doubt as to the scope and effect of section 1138d(f) of said title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking. There is no sound reason for differentiating between types of credit, insurance, banking and lending agencies in the punishment of conspiracy or in the requirement as to proof of overt acts. Since conspiracies involving offenses equally serious such as obstruction of justice, bribery, embezzlements, counterfeiting and false statements and offenses against the Treasury of the United States as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Home Owners' Loan Corporation are punishable under the general conspiracy statute, the same rule should be applied to lesser agencies. The blanket provision for punishment of "any person who willfully violates any other provision of this Act" was omitted as useless, in view of the specific provisions for penalties elsewhere in the Act. Editorial Notes Amendments 2001 — Pub. L. 107–56 substituted "10 years" for "five years" in two places. 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000" in two places. 1970 — Pub.

Such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title . The punishment prescribed by section 545 of this title was inserted to make this section complete without reference to another section. In doing so it was necessary to rephrase the punishment provision of section 545 of this title , as originally enacted, without change of substance.

The word "value" means face, par, or market value, or cost price, either wholesale or retail, whichever is greater. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 725 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(H), (L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 ; Pub. L. 104–294, title VI, §606(a), Oct. 11, 1996, 110 Stat. 3511 ; Pub. L. 108–275, §4, July 15, 2004, 118 Stat. 833 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§82, 87, 100, 101 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§35, 36, 47, 48, 35 Stat. 1095 , 1096-1098 ; Oct. 23, 1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015 ; June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996 ; Apr. 4, 1938, ch. 69, 52 Stat. 197 ; Nov. 22, 1943, ch. 302, 57 Stat. 591 .) Section consolidates sections 82, 87, 100, and 101 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. Changes necessary to effect the consolidation were made. Words "or shall willfully injure or commit any depredation against" were taken from said section 82 so as to confine it to embezzlement or theft. The quoted language, rephrased in the present tense, appears in section 1361 of this title . Words "in a jail" which followed "imprisonment" and preceded "for not more than one year" in said section 82, were omitted. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title .) Language relating to receiving stolen property is from said section 101. Words "or aid in concealing" were omitted as unnecessary in view of definitive section 2 of this title . Procedural language at end of said section 101 "and such person may be tried either before or after the conviction of the principal offender" was transferred to and rephrased in section 3435 of this title . Words "or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder" in said section 82 were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "agency" in section 6 of this title . The provisions for fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than 1 year for an offense involving $100 or less and for fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than 10 years, or both, for an offense involving a greater amount were written into this section as more in conformity with the later congressional policy expressed in sections 82 and 87 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., than the nongraduated penalties of sections 100 and 101 of said title 18. Since the purchasing power of the dollar is less than it was when $50 was the figure which determined whether larceny was petit larceny or grand larceny, the sum $100 was substituted as more consistent with modern values. The meaning of "value" in the last paragraph of the revised section is written to conform with that provided in section 2311 of this title by inserting the words "face, par, or". This section incorporates the recommendation of Paul W. Hyatt, president, board of commissioners of the Idaho State Bar Association, that sections 82 and 100 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., be combined and simplified. Also, with respect to section 101 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., this section meets the suggestion of P. F. Herrick, United States attorney for Puerto Rico, that the punishment provision of said section be amended to make the offense a misdemeanor where the amount involved is $50 or less. Changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 2004 — Pub. L. 108–275, in third par., inserted "in the aggregate, combining amounts from all the counts for which the defendant is convicted in a single case," after "value of such property". 1996 — Pub. L. 104–294 substituted "$1,000" for "$100" in third par. 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322, in third par., substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000" after "Shall be" and for "fined not more than $1,000" after "he shall be".

Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 593 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ( Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22, 38 Stat. 272 ; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, §5, 40 Stat. 970 ; Feb. 25, 1927, ch. 191, §15, 44 Stat. 1232 ; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §326(a), 49 Stat. 715 ). Other provisions of section 593 of title 12 , U.S.C. 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, are incorporated in sections 217 and 218 of this title . The words "and shall upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured. The phrase "bank or banking institution which is a member of the Federal Reserve System or which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation" was substituted for "member bank or insured bank" to avoid the use of a definitive section based on sections 221a, 264(e)(8), and 588a of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking. Words "banks the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation" were substituted for "insured banks" in second paragraph, for the same reason. Punishment provision harmonized with that of section 656 of this title . (See also, reviser's notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title .) Changes in phraseology were also made. Editorial Notes References in Text Section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978, referred to in text, is classified to section 3101 of Title 12 , Banks and Banking. Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act, referred to in text, is classified to subchapter I (§601 et seq.) of chapter 6 of Title 12 . Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, which is classified to subchapter II (§611 et seq.) of chapter 6 of Title 12 , was renumbered section 25A of that act by Pub. L. 102–242, title I, §142(e)(2), Dec. 19, 1991, 105 Stat. 2281 . Amendments 1996 — Pub. L. 104–294 substituted "$1,000" for "$100" in first par. 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322, in first par., substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000" after "organization, shall be" and for "fined not more than $1,000" after "he shall be". 1990 — Pub. L. 101–647, in first par., substituted "System, which is insured" for "System or which is insured", inserted "which is a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), or which is an organization operating under section 25 or section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act," after "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation," and "branch, agency, or organization," after "premises of such bank," and in second par. substituted "System, banks the deposits of which" for "System or banks the deposits of which", and inserted "branches or agencies of foreign banks (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), or organizations operating under section 25 or section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act," after "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,". 1 See References in Text note below. §656. Theft, embezzlement, or misapplication by bank officer or employee Whoever, being an officer, director, agent or employee of, or connected in any capacity with any Federal Reserve bank, member bank, depository institution holding company, national bank, insured bank, branch or agency of a foreign bank, or organization operating under section 25 or section 25(a) 1 of the Federal Reserve Act, or a receiver of a national bank, insured bank, branch, agency, or organization or any agent or employee of the receiver, or a Federal Reserve Agent, or an agent or employee of a Federal Reserve Agent or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, embezzles, abstracts, purloins or willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds or credits of such bank, branch, agency, or organization or holding company or any moneys, funds, assets or securities intrusted to the custody or care of such bank, branch, agency, or organization, or holding company or to the custody or care of any such agent, officer, director, employee or receiver, shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both; but if the amount embezzled, abstracted, purloined or misapplied does not exceed $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. As used in this section, the term "national bank" is synonymous with "national banking association"; "member bank" means and includes any national bank, state bank, or bank and trust company which has become a member of one of the Federal Reserve banks; "insured bank" includes any bank, banking association, trust company, savings bank, or other banking institution, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and the term "branch or agency of a foreign bank" means a branch or agency described in section 20(9) of this title . For purposes of this section, the term "depository institution holding company" has the meaning given such term in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 729 ; Pub. L. 101–73, title IX, §961(b), Aug. 9, 1989, 103 Stat. 499 ; Pub.

L. 104–294, title VI, §§601(f)(1), 606(a), Oct. 11, 1996, 110 Stat. 3499 , 3511 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 592, 597 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. 5209; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22(i), as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, §3, 48 Stat. 1107 ; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, §7, 40 Stat. 972 ; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §316, 49 Stat. 712 ). Section 592 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, was separated into three sections the first of which, embracing provisions relating to embezzlement, abstracting, purloining, or willfully misapplying moneys, funds, or credits, constitutes part of the basis for this section. Of the other two sections, one section, 334 of this title, relates only to the issuance and circulation of Federal Reserve notes and the other, section 1005 of this title , to false entries or the wrongful issue of bank obligations. The original section, containing more than 500 words, was verbose, diffuse, redundant, and complicated. The enumeration of banks affected is repeated eight times. The revised section without changing in any way the meaning or substance of existing law, clarifies, condenses, and combines related provisions largely rewritten in matters of style. The words "national bank" were substituted for "national banking association," the terms being synonymous by definition of section 221 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, written into the last paragraph of this section. This change made possible the use of the term "such bank" in substitution for the words "such Federal Reserve bank, member bank, or such national banking association, or insured bank," in each of seven instances. The special and separate provisions of the original section relating to embezzlement by national bank receivers or Federal Reserve agents are readily combined in the revised section by including these officers in the initial enumeration of persons at whom the act is directed and by inserting the word "purloins" after "embezzles, abstracts," and the phrase "or any moneys, funds, assets, or securities intrusted to the custody or care," following the words "of such bank". The last paragraph of the revised section includes the definitions of sections 221 and 264(c) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, made applicable by express provision of the original section. These were written in, with only such changes of phraseology as were necessary, in order to make the revised section complete and self-contained. For meaning of "bank," as used in bank robbery statute, see section 2113 of this title . Section 597 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, likewise was separated into two parts, one of which was combined with the embezzlement provisions of said section 592 to form this section. The other part was combined with the related provisions of said section 592 to form section 1005 of this title . It will be noted that section 597 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, was limited to "Whoever, being connected in any capacity with a Federal Reserve bank"; that it enumerated "note, debenture, bond, or other obligation, or draft, mortgage, judgment, or decree"; and that it stipulated punishment by fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both. In combining these provisions, the words "or connected in any capacity" were written into the new section after the words "employee of," thus making them applicable not only to Federal Reserve banks but to the other banks as well. The phrase of section 592 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, "or who, without such authority, issues or puts forth any certificate of deposit, draws any order or bill of exchange, makes any acceptance, assigns any note, bond, draft, bill of exchange, mortgage, judgment, or decree," was modified to include the enumeration of like obligations in section 597 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and to read as follows: "whoever without such authority makes, draws, issues, puts forth, or assigns any certificate of deposit, draft, order, bill of exchange, acceptance, note, debenture, bond, or other obligation or mortgage, judgment, or decree". (See section 1005 of this title .) As thus changed the new section is clear, simple, and unambiguous. The very slight changes of substance that have been noted, were unavoidable if the two sections were to be combined. Without combination any constructive revision of these duplicitous and redundant provisions was impossible. It is believed that the revised sections adequately and correctly represent the intent of Congress as the same can be gathered from the overlapping and confusing enactments. At any rate, the severest criticism of the revised sections is that a person connected with a Federal Reserve bank who violates these sections can at most be punished by a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment of 5 years, or both, whereas under section 597 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, he might have been fined $10,000 or imprisoned 5 years, or both. Obviously an embezzler will rarely be financially able to pay even a $5,000 fine even where such fine is imposed. Certainly if it is an adequate fine for a national bank president it is not too disproportionate for a person "connected in any capacity with a Federal Reserve bank". The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes under sections 641, 645 of this title .) The words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor" were omitted as unnecessary in view of definitive section 1 of this title . The words "upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed without conviction. Words "In any district court of the United States" were omitted as unnecessary since section 3231 of this title gives the district courts jurisdiction of criminal prosecution. Senate Revision Amendment Certain words were stricken from the section as being unnecessary and inconsistent with other sections of this revision defining embezzlement and without changing existing law. See Senate Report No. 1620, amendment No. 6, 80th Cong.

Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on sections 1026(b) and 1514(c) of title 7 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and sections 264(u), 984, 1121, 1138d(c), 1311, 1441(c), 1467(c), and 1731(c) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(c) of title 15 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §12B(u), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, §8, 48 Stat. 178 ; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §31, fourth paragraph, 39 Stat. 382 ; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §211(a), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, §2, 42 Stat. 1459 ; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, §216(a), 42 Stat. 1471 ; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16(c), 47 Stat. 11 ; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21(c), 47 Stat. 738 ; Mar. 27, 1933, Ex. Ord. No. 6084; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, §8(c), 48 Stat. 135 ; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64(c), 48 Stat. 268 ; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, §13, 48 Stat. 347 ; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, §512(c), 48 Stat. 1265 ; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §101, 49 Stat. 701 ; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, §52(b), 50 Stat. 532 ; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, §514(c), 52 Stat. 76 ; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, §3, 60 Stat. 1064 ). Each of the eleven sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions relating to embezzlement, false entries, and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligations with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations. These were separated and the embezzlement and misapplication provisions of all form the basis of this section, and with one exception the remaining provisions of each section forming the basis for section 1006 of this title . The sole exception was that portion of said section 616(c) of title 15 as to the disclosure of information which now forms section 1904 of this title . The revised section condenses and simplifies the constituent provisions without change of substance except as in this note indicated. The punishment in each section was the same except that in section 1026(b) of title 7 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, the maximum fine was $5,000. The revised section adopts the $5,000 maximum. (For same penalty covering similar offense, see section 656 of this title .) The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes to sections 641–645 of this title .) The enumeration of "moneys, funds, credits, securities, or other things of value" does not occur in any one of the original sections but is an adequate, composite enumeration of the instruments mentioned in each. References to persons aiding and abetting contained in sections 984, 1121, 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were omitted as unnecessary, such persons being made principals by section 2 of this title . The term "receiver" is used in sections 1121 and 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, with reference to Federal intermediate banks and agricultural credit corporations, and is undoubtedly embraced in the term "connected in any capacity with," but the phrase "and whoever, being a receiver of any such institution" was inserted in this section to obviate all doubt as to its comprehensive scope. The suggestion has been made that "private examiners" should be included. These undoubtedly are covered by the words "connected in any capacity with." (See also section 655 of this title .) The term "or any department or agency of the United States" was inserted in each revised section in order to clarify the sweeping provisions against fraudulent acts and to obviate any possibility of ambiguity by reason of the omission of specific agencies named in the constituent sections. (See section 6 of this title defining "department and agency." For other verbal changes and deletions see reviser's note under section 656 of this title .) Senate Revision Amendment Certain words were stricken from the section as being unnecessary and inconsistent with other sections of this revision defining embezzlement and without changing existing law. See Senate Report No. 1620, amendment No. 7, 80th Cong. 1949 Act [Section 11] conforms section 657 of title 18 , U.S.C., to administrative practice which in turn was modified to comply with congressional policy "not to use the Farmers Home Corporation to carry out the functions and duties provided for in H.R. 5991 [Farmers Home Administration Act of 1946] but to vest the authority in the Secretary of Agriculture to be administered through the Farmers Home Administration as an agency of the Department of Agriculture" (H. Rept. No. 2683, to accompany H.R. 5991, 79th Cong., 2d sess.). Editorial Notes References in Text The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, referred to in text, is Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on sections 1026(c) and 1514(d) of title 7 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and section 1138d(d) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ( June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64, 48 Stat. 269 ; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, §13, 48 Stat. 347 ; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, §52(c), 50 Stat. 532 ; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, §514(d), 52 Stat. 76 ; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, §3, 60 Stat. 1064 ). To avoid reference to another section the words "the Farm Credit Administration, any Federal intermediate credit bank, the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Farmers' Home Corporation, or any production credit corporation or corporation in which a production credit corporation holds stock, any regional agricultural credit corporation, or any bank for cooperatives" were substituted for the words "or any corporation referred to in subsection (a) of this section." The punishment provision was completely rewritten. The $2,000 fine of section 1026(c) of title 7 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the 2-year penalty of that section, section 1514(d) of title 7 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 1138(d) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were incongruous in juxtaposition with other sections of this chapter and were therefore increased to $5,000 and 5 years. (See sections 656 and 657 of this title .) The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title .) Minor changes were made in phraseology. 1949 Act [Section 12] conforms section 658 of title 18 U.S.C., to administrative practice which in turn was modified to comply with congressional policy. (See note to sec. 11 [of 1949 Act, set out in Legislative History note under section 657 of title 18 ]).

Interstate or foreign shipments by carrier; State prosecutions Whoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully takes, carries away, or conceals, or by fraud or deception obtains from any pipeline system, railroad car, wagon, motortruck, trailer, or other vehicle, or from any tank or storage facility, station, station house, platform or depot or from any steamboat, vessel, or wharf, or from any aircraft, air cargo container, air terminal, airport, aircraft terminal or air navigation facility, or from any intermodal container, trailer, container freight station, warehouse, or freight consolidation facility, with intent to convert to his own use any goods or chattels moving as or which are a part of or which constitute an interstate or foreign shipment of freight, express, or other property; or Whoever buys or receives or has in his possession any such goods or chattels, knowing the same to have been embezzled or stolen; or Whoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully takes, carries away, or by fraud or deception obtains with intent to convert to his own use any baggage which shall have come into the possession of any common carrier for transportation in interstate or foreign commerce or breaks into, steals, takes, carries away, or conceals any of the contents of such baggage, or buys, receives, or has in his possession any such baggage or any article therefrom of whatever nature, knowing the same to have been embezzled or stolen; or Whoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully takes by any fraudulent device, scheme, or game, from any railroad car, bus, vehicle, steamboat, vessel, or aircraft operated by any common carrier moving in interstate or foreign commerce or from any passenger thereon any money, baggage, goods, or chattels, or whoever buys, receives, or has in his possession any such money, baggage, goods, or chattels, knowing the same to have been embezzled or stolen— Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both, but if the amount or value of such money, baggage, goods, or chattels is less than $1,000, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than 3 years, or both. If the offense involves a pre-retail medical product (as defined in section 670), it shall be punished under section 670 unless the penalties provided for under this section are greater. The offense shall be deemed to have been committed not only in the district where the violation first occurred, but also in any district in which the defendant may have taken or been in possession of the said money, baggage, goods, or chattels. The carrying or transporting of any such money, freight, express, baggage, goods, or chattels in interstate or foreign commerce, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall constitute a separate offense and subject the offender to the penalties under this section for unlawful taking, and the offense shall be deemed to have been committed in any district into which such money, freight, express, baggage, goods, or chattels shall have been removed or into which the same shall have been brought by such offender. To establish the interstate or foreign commerce character of any shipment in any prosecution under this section the waybill or other shipping document of such shipment shall be prima facie evidence of the place from which and to which such shipment was made. For purposes of this section, goods and chattel shall be construed to be moving as an interstate or foreign shipment at all points between the point of origin and the final destination (as evidenced by the waybill or other shipping document of the shipment), regardless of any temporary stop while awaiting transshipment or otherwise. The removal of property from a pipeline system which extends interstate shall be prima facie evidence of the interstate character of the shipment of the property. A judgment of conviction or acquittal on the merits under the laws of any State shall be a bar to any prosecution under this section for the same act or acts. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of Congress to occupy the field in which provisions of this section operate to the exclusion of State laws on the same subject matter, nor shall any provision of this section be construed as invalidating any provision of State law unless such provision is inconsistent with any of the purposes of this section or any provision thereof.

This section consolidates sections 409, 410, and 411 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. First clause of said section 409 was incorporated in section 2117 of this title . In the paragraph immediately preceding the last paragraph the words "and to which" were added to obviate an inadvertent and incongruous omission in the enactment of act July 24, 1946, ch. 606, §3, 60 Stat. 657 . This is in harmony with corrective legislation pending before the Eightieth Congress. The definitions of "station house", "depot", "wagon", "automobile", "truck", or "other vehicle", contained in said section 409 of title 18 , are omitted as unnecessary.

Section consolidates a portion of section 409 with section 412, both of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Other provisions of said section 409 are incorporated in sections 659 and 2117 of this title . Definitive language in section 412 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to offense being a felony was deleted to conform with section 1 of this title .

Maximum fine of $5,000 was substituted for minimum fine of $500 in section 412 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., as being more consonant with the scheme of penalties and offenses provided by Congress for most sections in this chapter.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §466 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §287, 35 Stat. 1144 ). Words "within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States" were inserted to conform with section 7 of this title . (See reviser's note under that section.) The maximum fine and imprisonment provisions were modified and "five years" and "$5,000" substituted for "ten years" and "$10,000" and the sum of $100 was substituted for $50 as more in accord with other sections of this chapter. (See section 641 of this title .) Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1996 — Pub. L. 104–294, in second par., substituted "$1,000" for "$100" and substituted "fine under this title" for "fine of under this title" in two places. 1994 — Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §467 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §288, 35 Stat. 1145 ). Same language was inserted as in section 661 of this title for the same reason. Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative. The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title .) This accords with the recommendation of United States Attorney P. F. Herrick of Puerto Rico. Language as to order of trial was omitted and incorporated in section 3435 of this title . Editorial Notes Amendments 1996 — Pub. L. 104–294 substituted "$1,000" for "$100". 1994 — Pub.

This section was taken from the Second War Powers Act of 1942, which was temporary legislation. However, the subject matter was so independent of the war effort as to warrant its inclusion in this title as a permanent provision. Words "shall be guilty of a felony" were omitted. See Reviser's Note under section 550 of this title . Words "and upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000". §664. Theft or embezzlement from employee benefit plan Any person who embezzles, steals, or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use or to the use of another, any of the moneys, funds, securities, premiums, credits, property, or other assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan, or of any fund connected therewith, shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

"Auxiliary of such" was inserted to extend protection to the uniforms of any auxiliary corps that may be established. Fine of "$250" was substituted for "$300" as being more consonant with the penalties provided for similar offenses in this chapter. Minor changes of phraseology also were made. 1949 Act This section [section 15] inserts "armed forces" in the catch line and text of section 702 of title 18 , U.S.C., and thereby includes the Air Force which was formerly part of the Army. (See note to sec. 5 [of 1949 Act, set out in Legislative History note under section 244 of title 18 ]).

Words "upon conviction" were deleted as surplusage, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

Fine of "$250" was substituted for "$300" as being more consonant with the penalties provided for similar offenses in this chapter. Words "unless such wearing thereof be authorized by such state, nation, or government" were deleted as unnecessary and undesirable since it is unthinkable that a friendly power would authorize such deceit.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 264(v)(1), 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 1128, 1318, 1441(d), 1731(d) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, section 616(d) of title 15 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, and section 1426 of title 42 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Public Health and Welfare ( R.S. §5243 ; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §12B(v), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, §8, 48 Stat. 178 ; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §211h, as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, §2, 42 Stat. 1461 ; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, §216, 42 Stat. 1471 ; May 24, 1926, ch. 377, §§1–4, 44 Stat. 628 ; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16(d), 47 Stat. 12 ; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21, 47 Stat. 738 ; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, §512, 48 Stat. 1265 ; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §§101, 203a, 318, 332, 49 Stat. 684 , 704 , 712 , 719 ; Apr. 21, 1936, ch. 244, 49 Stat. 1237 ; Sept. 1, 1937, ch. 896, §26, 50 Stat. 899 ; Feb. 3, 1938, ch. 13, §§9, 10, 52 Stat. 24 , 25 ; June 28, 1941, ch. 261, §10, 55 Stat. 365 ). Numerous sections were consolidated with changes both of phraseology and substance necessary to effect consolidation. The proviso of section 585 of said title 12 was omitted, since the consolidated section obviously cannot be construed as forbidding Federal agencies, boards, and corporations from using their legal names. The right to continue the use of a name, lawful on the effective date of this section, is preserved. Last paragraph is based upon section 587 of said title 12. Words "At the suit of" were substituted for "at the instance of". United States Attorneys are the chief law officers of the districts. United States v. Smith , 1895, 15 S. Ct. 846, 158 U.S. 346, 39 L. Ed. 1011; McKay v. Rogers , C. C. A. Okl. 1936, 82 F. 2d 795. Federal courts will not recognize suits on behalf of the United States unless the Government is represented by a United States Attorney. Confiscation cases, La. 1868, 7 Wall. 454, 19 L. Ed. 196. The words "any duly authorized representative of any department or agency of the United States" were substituted for the enumeration of agencies which may make complaint thus making the provision more flexible and less cumbersome. This consolidated section reconciles the disparities and inconsistencies of 12 sections; thus providing a harmonious scheme for the punishment of similar offenses. The punishment provision was drawn from section 587 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, but is in substance and effect the same as in sections 264v(1), 1441(d) and 1731(d) of said title 12, but the civil penalty of $50 per day which was in sections 583, 1128, and 1318 of said title 12, was omitted as inconsistent with later acts dealing with similar offenses. Too often actions to recover civil penalties result in judgments which cannot be collected, and yet as long as they remain uncollected they clog the administration of justice. It was necessary to substitute a fine in place of a $50 per diem penalty for business entities embraced in sections 583, 1128, and 1318 of said title 12, and fine and imprisonment for individuals responsible for such violations. Similarly the penalty of $1,000 fine in section 1426 of title 42 , The Public Health and Welfare, was changed to permit alternative fine or imprisonment for individuals responsible for violation.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§753h, 909 ( May 14, 1930, ch. 274, §9, 46 Stat. 327 ; May 27, 1930, ch. 339, §9, 46 Stat. 390 ; Aug. 3, 1935, ch. 432, 49 Stat. 513 ). Sections 753h and 909 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were consolidated. Section 753h is later and more comprehensive. The substance of its provisions was adopted. References to offenses as felonies or misdemeanors were omitted in view of definitive section 1 of this title . (See also reviser's notes under section 550 of this title .) Mandatory provision as to separate sentences and order of service was omitted in order to permit court to exercise discretion as to whether sentences should be concurrent or consecutive and to obviate administration problems in enforcement of section. Words "or employee" were inserted to remove ambiguity as to scope of section. Reference to "custody or confinement is for extradition" was inserted to avoid possible ambiguity. Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000" after "any offense, be" and for "fined not more than $1,000" after "conviction, be" in subsec.

See chapter 43 (§631 et seq.) of Title 28 . §752. Instigating or assisting escape (a) Whoever rescues or attempts to rescue or instigates, aids or assists the escape, or attempt to escape, of any person arrested upon a warrant or other process issued under any law of the United States, or committed to the custody of the Attorney General or to any institution or facility by his direction, shall, if the custody or confinement is by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of any offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both; or, if the custody or confinement is for extradition, or for exclusion or expulsion proceedings under the immigration laws, or by virtue of an arrest or charge of or for a misdemeanor, and prior to conviction, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. (b) Whoever rescues or attempts to rescue or instigates, aids, or assists the escape or attempted escape of any person in the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative, or of any person arrested upon a warrant or other process issued under any law of the United States or from any institution or facility in which he is confined by direction of the Attorney General, shall, if the custody or confinement is by virtue of a lawful arrest for a violation of any law of the United States not punishable by death or life imprisonment and committed before such person's eighteenth birthday, and as to whom the Attorney General has not specifically directed the institution of criminal proceedings, or by virtue of a commitment as a juvenile delinquent under section 5034 of this title , be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

B, title IV, §4002(d)(1)(D), Nov. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 1809 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§246, 247, 252, 661, 662c, 753i, 910 ( R.S. §5277 ; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§141, 143, 35 Stat. 1114 ; May 14, 1930, ch. 274, §10, 46 Stat. 327 ; May 27, 1930, ch. 339, §10, 46 Stat. 390 ; Mar. 22, 1934, ch. 73, §2, 48 Stat. 455 ; May 18, 1934, ch. 303, §1, 48 Stat. 782 ). Section consolidated escape and rescue provisions of sections 246, 247, 252, 661, 662c, 753i, and 910 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. Remaining provisions of those sections are in sections 1071, 1072, 1502, 1792, 3183, and 3195 of this title . No two sections provided the same punishment. Every section except said section 252 made the offense a misdemeanor by providing for fines varying from $500 to $1,000 and terms of imprisonment varying from 6 months to 1 year. Said section 252, representing the latest expression by Congress, provided for 10 years' imprisonment. The punishment provision was adopted from section 751 of this title , which makes it unlawful for a prisoner to escape from his place of confinement. Thus the same punishment would apply to the person aiding in an escape as to the person escaping. The language of this section reconciles the conflict by adopting a penalty which is a compromise between the varying provisions. Reference to "extradition" was inserted to avoid ambiguity and to harmonize section with section 751 of this title . References to "force" were omitted as well as those to "officer" or "custody." See definition of "Rescue," Black's Law Dictionary, citing 4 Bl. Comm. 131. Changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 2002 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 107–273 substituted "or conviction of any offense, be fined under this title" for "or conviction of any offense, be fined not more than $5,000". 1994 —Subsecs. (a), (b). Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000". 1988 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 100–690 inserted ", or for exclusion or expulsion proceedings under the immigration laws," after "extradition". 1965 — Pub. L. 89–176 inserted "or facility" after "institution". 1963 — Pub. L. 88–251 designated existing provisions as subsec. (a) and added subsec. (b). 1956 —Act May 28, 1956, inserted ", or attempt to escape," after "escape". §753. Rescue to prevent execution Whoever, by force, sets at liberty or rescues any person found guilty in any court of the United States of any capital crime, while going to execution or during execution, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 735 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(O), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §248 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §142, 35 Stat. 1114 ). Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative. Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $25,000". [§754. Repealed. Pub.

Officer permitting escape Whoever, having in his custody any prisoner by virtue of process issued under the laws of the United States by any court, judge, or magistrate judge, voluntarily suffers such prisoner to escape, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both; or if he negligently suffers such person to escape, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

Sections 244, 662e and 665 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were consolidated. The two latter sections merely extended application of the former. This section has been greatly condensed by changes in phraseology which do not affect the substance. Enumeration of "marshal, deputy marshal, ministerial officer, or other person," was omitted as surplusage. Provision making section applicable to cases of prisoners in custody pending extradition or removal proceedings as well as prisoners convicted of offenses against the United States was likewise omitted as unnecessary. Changes in phraseology were made. Senate Revision Amendment The text of this section was changed by Senate amendment in view of the act of June 21, 1947, ch. 111, 61 Stat. 134 , which, by amending section 244 of Title 18 , U.S.C., became an additional source of this section. The amendment constitutes the last clause of this section. See Senate Report No. 1620, amendment No. 8, 80th Cong. Editorial Notes Amendments 1996 — Pub.

Findings and Purpose of Title V of Pub. L. 104–132 Relating to Nuclear Materials Pub. L. 104–132, title V, §501, Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1281 , provided that: "(a) Findings .—The Congress finds that— "(1) nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can be used to create radioactive dispersal devices that are capable of causing serious bodily injury as well as substantial damage to property and to the environment; "(2) the potential use of nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security interests of the United States; "(3) due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat of nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the United States has a strong interest in ensuring that persons who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for their offenses; "(4) the threat that nuclear materials will be obtained and used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has increased substantially since the enactment in 1982 of the legislation that implemented the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, codified at section 831 of title 18, United States Code ; "(5) the successful efforts to obtain agreements from other countries to dismantle nuclear weapons have resulted in increased packaging and transportation of nuclear materials, thereby decreasing the security of such materials by increasing the opportunity for unlawful diversion and theft; "(6) the trafficking in the relatively more common, commercially available, and usable nuclear and byproduct materials creates the potential for significant loss of life and environmental damage; "(7) report trafficking incidents in the early 1990's suggest that the individuals involved in trafficking in these materials from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently conducted their black market sales of these materials within the Federal Republic of Germany, the Baltic States, the former Soviet Union, Central Europe, and to a lesser extent in the Middle European countries; "(8) the international community has become increasingly concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials; "(9) the potentially disastrous ramifications of increased access to nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials pose such a significant threat that the United States must use all lawful methods available to combat the illegal use of such materials; "(10) the United States has an interest in encouraging United States corporations to do business in the countries that comprised the former Soviet Union, and in other developing democracies; "(11) protection of such United States corporations from threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials is important to the success of the effort to encourage business ventures in these countries, and to further the foreign relations and commerce of the United States; "(12) the nature of nuclear contamination is such that it may affect the health, environment, and property of United States nationals even if the acts that constitute the illegal activity occur outside the territory of the United States, and are primarily directed toward foreign nationals; and "(13) there is presently no Federal criminal statute that provides adequate protection to United States interests from nonweapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material, and from the illegal diversion of nuclear materials that are held for other than peaceful purposes. "(b) Purpose .—The purpose of this title [enacting section 2332c of this title , amending this section and sections 175, 177, 178, and 2332a of this title , and enacting provisions set out as notes under section 262 of Title 42 , The Public Health and Welfare, and section 1522 of Title 50 , War and National Defense] is to provide Federal law enforcement agencies with the necessary means and the maximum authority permissible under the Constitution to combat the threat of nuclear contamination and proliferation that may result from the illegal possession and use of radioactive materials." §832. Participation in nuclear and weapons of mass destruction threats to the United States (a) Whoever, within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, willfully participates in or knowingly provides material support or resources (as defined in section 2339A) to a nuclear weapons program or other weapons of mass destruction program of a foreign terrorist power, or attempts or conspires to do so, shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years. (b) There is extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section. (c) Whoever without lawful authority develops, possesses, or attempts or conspires to develop or possess a radiological weapon, or threatens to use or uses a radiological weapon against any person within the United States, or a national of the United States while such national is outside of the United States or against any property that is owned, leased, funded, or used by the United States, whether that property is within or outside of the United States, shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life. (d) As used in this section— (1) "nuclear weapons program" means a program or plan for the development, acquisition, or production of any nuclear weapon or weapons; (2) "weapons of mass destruction program" means a program or plan for the development, acquisition, or production of any weapon or weapons of mass destruction (as defined in section 2332a(c)); (3) "foreign terrorist power" means a terrorist organization designated under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or a state sponsor of terrorism designated under section 6(j) 1 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 or section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; and (4) "nuclear weapon" means any weapon that contains or uses nuclear material as defined in section 831(f)(1). 1 (Added Pub.

L. 90–321, title II, §202(a), May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 159 , added chapter 42 and items 891 to 896. §891. Definitions and rules of construction For the purposes of this chapter: (1) To extend credit means to make or renew any loan, or to enter into any agreement, tacit or express, whereby the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim, whether acknowledged or disputed, valid or invalid, and however arising, may or will be deferred. (2) The term "creditor", with reference to any given extension of credit, refers to any person making that extension of credit, or to any person claiming by, under, or through any person making that extension of credit. (3) The term "debtor", with reference to any given extension of credit, refers to any person to whom that extension of credit is made, or to any person who guarantees the repayment of that extension of credit, or in any manner undertakes to indemnify the creditor against loss resulting from the failure of any person to whom that extension of credit is made to repay the same. (4) The repayment of any extension of credit includes the repayment, satisfaction, or discharge in whole or in part of any debt or claim, acknowledged or disputed, valid or invalid, resulting from or in connection with that extension of credit. (5) To collect an extension of credit means to induce in any way any person to make repayment thereof. (6) An extortionate extension of credit is any extension of credit with respect to which it is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time it is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person. (7) An extortionate means is any means which involves the use, or an express or implicit threat of use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person. (8) The term "State" includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories and possessions of the United States. (9) State law, including conflict of laws rules, governing the enforceability through civil judicial processes of repayment of any extension of credit or the performance of any promise given in consideration thereof shall be judicially noticed. This paragraph does not impair any authority which any court would otherwise have to take judicial notice of any matter of State law. (Added Pub. L. 90–321, title II, §202(a), May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 160 .) Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purpose Pub. L. 90–321, title II, §201, May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 159 , provided that: "(a) The Congress makes the following findings: "(1) Organized crime is interstate and international in character. Its activities involve many billions of dollars each year. It is directly responsible for murders, willful injuries to person and property, corruption of officials, and terrorization of countless citizens. A substantial part of the income of organized crime is generated by extortionate credit transactions. "(2) Extortionate credit transactions are characterized by the use, or the express or implicit threat of the use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to person, reputation, or property as a means of enforcing repayment. Among the factors which have rendered past efforts at prosecution almost wholly ineffective has been the existence of exclusionary rules of evidence stricter than necessary for the protection of constitutional rights. "(3) Extortionate credit transactions are carried on to a substantial extent in interstate and foreign commerce and through the means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where extortionate credit transactions are purely intrastate in character, they nevertheless directly affect interstate and foreign commerce. "(4) Extortionate credit transactions directly impair the effectiveness and frustrate the purposes of the laws enacted by the Congress on the subject of bankruptcies. "(b) On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Congress determines that the provisions of chapter 42 of title 18 of the United States Code are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform and effective laws on the subject of bankruptcy." Annual Report to Congress by Attorney General Pub. L. 90–321, title II, §203, May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 162 , directed Attorney General to make an annual report to Congress of activities of Department of Justice in enforcement of this chapter, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 97–375, title I, §109(b), Dec. 21, 1982, 96 Stat. 1820 . §892. Making extortionate extensions of credit (a) Whoever makes any extortionate extension of credit, or conspires to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. (b) In any prosecution under this section, if it is shown that all of the following factors were present in connection with the extension of credit in question, there is prima facie evidence that the extension of credit was extortionate, but this subsection is nonexclusive and in no way limits the effect or applicability of subsection (a): (1) The repayment of the extension of credit, or the performance of any promise given in consideration thereof, would be unenforceable, through civil judicial processes against the debtor (A) in the jurisdiction within which the debtor, if a natural person, resided or (B) in every jurisdiction within which the debtor, if other than a natural person, was incorporated or qualified to do business at the time the extension of credit was made. (2) The extension of credit was made at a rate of interest in excess of an annual rate of 45 per centum calculated according to the actuarial method of allocating payments made on a debt between principal and interest, pursuant to which a payment is applied first to the accumulated interest and the balance is applied to the unpaid principal. (3) At the time the extension of credit was made, the debtor reasonably believed that either (A) one or more extensions of credit by the creditor had been collected or attempted to be collected by extortionate means, or the nonrepayment thereof had been punished by extortionate means; or (B) the creditor had a reputation for the use of extortionate means to collect extensions of credit or to punish the nonrepayment thereof. (4) Upon the making of the extension of credit, the total of the extensions of credit by the creditor to the debtor then outstanding, including any unpaid interest or similar charges, exceeded $100. (c) In any prosecution under this section, if evidence has been introduced tending to show the existence of any of the circumstances described in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2), and direct evidence of the actual belief of the debtor as to the creditor's collection practices is not available, then for the purpose of showing the understanding of the debtor and the creditor at the time the extension of credit was made, the court may in its discretion allow evidence to be introduced tending to show the reputation as to collection practices of the creditor in any community of which the debtor was a member at the time of the extension.

(a). Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000". §893. Financing extortionate extensions of credit Whoever willfully advances money or property, whether as a gift, as a loan, as an investment, pursuant to a partnership or profit-sharing agreement, or otherwise, to any person, with reasonable grounds to believe that it is the intention of that person to use the money or property so advanced directly or indirectly for the purpose of making extortionate extensions of credit, shall be fined under this title or an amount not exceeding twice the value of the money or property so advanced, whichever is greater, or shall be imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. (Added Pub. L. 90–321, title II, §202(a), May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 161 ; amended Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000". §894. Collection of extensions of credit by extortionate means (a) Whoever knowingly participates in any way, or conspires to do so, in the use of any extortionate means (1) to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit, or (2) to punish any person for the nonrepayment thereof, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. (b) In any prosecution under this section, for the purpose of showing an implicit threat as a means of collection, evidence may be introduced tending to show that one or more extensions of credit by the creditor were, to the knowledge of the person against whom the implicit threat was alleged to have been made, collected or attempted to be collected by extortionate means or that the nonrepayment thereof was punished by extortionate means. (c) In any prosecution under this section, if evidence has been introduced tending to show the existence, at the time the extension of credit in question was made, of the circumstances described in section 892(b)(1) or the circumstances described in section 892(b)(2), and direct evidence of the actual belief of the debtor as to the creditor's collection practices is not available, then for the purpose of showing that words or other means of communication, shown to have been employed as a means of collection, in fact carried an express or implicit threat, the court may in its discretion allow evidence to be introduced tending to show the reputation of the defendant in any community of which the person against whom the alleged threat was made was a member at the time of the collection or attempt at collection.

Effect on State laws This chapter does not preempt any field of law with respect to which State legislation would be permissible in the absence of this chapter. No law of any State which would be valid in the absence of this chapter may be held invalid or inapplicable by virtue of the existence of this chapter, and no officer, agency, or instrumentality of any State may be deprived by virtue of this chapter of any jurisdiction over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the absence of this chapter.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on subsection (a), paragraph (18) and subsection (d), of section 746, title 8 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality ( Oct. 14, 1940, ch. 876, §346(a), par. (18), and (d), 54 Stat. 1165 , 1167 ). Section consolidates said provisions of section 746, title 8 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality. The word "willfully" was substituted for "knowingly", "$1,000" for "$5,000", and "three years" for "five years", to harmonize with congressional intent evidenced by the other sections of this chapter. Minor changes were made in phraseology and unnecessary words were omitted. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000". §912. Officer or employee of the United States Whoever falsely assumes or pretends to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or any department, agency or officer thereof, and acts as such, or in such pretended character demands or obtains any money, paper, document, or thing of value, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 742 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§76 and 123 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§32 and 66, 35 Stat. 1095 , 1100 ; Feb. 28, 1938, ch. 37, 52 Stat. 82 ). Section consolidates sections 76 and 123 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. The effect of this consolidation was to increase the punishment for revenue officers from $500 to $1,000 and from 2 years to 3 years, and to rephrase in the alternative the mandatory punishment provision. This section now applies the same punishment to all officers and agents of the United States found guilty of false personation. Words "agency or" were inserted to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive section 6 of this title .) Other words referring to "authority of any corporation owned or controlled by the United States" were omitted for the same reason. (See Pierce v. U.S ., 1941, 62 S. Ct. 237, 314 U.S. 306, 86 L. Ed. 226.) The words "with the intent to defraud the United States or any person", contained in said section 76 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as meaningless in view of United States v. Lapowich , 63 S. Ct. 914. Changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000". §913.

( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 742 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §77a ( Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 740, §201, 49 Stat. 877 ). Words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor" were omitted. (See definitive section 1 of this title .) Words "and upon conviction thereof" preceding "shall be" were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured. Maximum imprisonment provision was changed from 1 year to 3 years so as to be consistent with sections 911 and 912 of this title , the latter having also been changed to 3 years. There is no sound reason why a uniform punishment should not be prescribed for the offenses defined in these three sections. Changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §78 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §33, 35 Stat. 1095 ). Words "prize money" after "pension" were deleted as repealed by act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 413, 30 Stat. 1007 , repealing all laws authorizing prize money distribution. Mandatory punishment was rephrased in the alternative. In the punishment provision the words "five years" were substituted for "ten years" to harmonize it with the punishment provisions in sections 287 and 1001 of this title , covering similar offenses.

L. 90–351, title IV, §901, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 225 , provided that: "(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares— "(1) that there is a widespread traffic in firearms moving in or otherwise affecting interstate or foreign commerce, and that the existing Federal controls over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to control this traffic within their own borders through the exercise of their police power; "(2) that the ease with which any person can acquire firearms other than a rifle or shotgun (including criminals, juveniles without the knowledge or consent of their parents or guardians, narcotics addicts, mental defectives, armed groups who would supplant the functions of duly constituted public authorities, and others whose possession of such weapon is similarly contrary to the public interest) is a significant factor in the prevalence of lawlessness and violent crime in the United States; "(3) that only through adequate Federal control over interstate and foreign commerce in these weapons, and over all persons engaging in the businesses of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in them, can this grave problem be properly dealt with, and effective State and local regulation of this traffic be made possible; "(4) that the acquisition on a mail-order basis of firearms other than a rifle or shotgun by nonlicensed individuals, from a place other than their State of residence, has materially tended to thwart the effectiveness of State laws and regulations, and local ordinances; "(5) that the sale or other disposition of concealable weapons by importers, manufacturers, and dealers holding Federal licenses, to nonresidents of the State in which the licensees' places of business are located, has tended to make ineffective the laws, regulations, and ordinances in the several States and local jurisdictions regarding such firearms; "(6) that there is a casual relationship between the easy availability of firearms other than a rifle or shotgun and juvenile and youthful criminal behavior, and that such firearms have been widely sold by federally licensed importers and dealers to emotionally immature, or thrill-bent juveniles and minors prone to criminal behavior; "(7) that the United States has become the dumping ground of the castoff surplus military weapons of other nations, and that such weapons, and the large volume of relatively inexpensive pistols and revolvers (largely worthless for sporting purposes), imported into the United States in recent years, has contributed greatly to lawlessness and to the Nation's law enforcement problems; "(8) that the lack of adequate Federal control over interstate and foreign commerce in highly destructive weapons (such as bazookas, mortars, antitank guns, and so forth, and destructive devices such as explosive or incendiary grenades, bombs, missiles, and so forth) has allowed such weapons and devices to fall into the hands of lawless persons, including armed groups who would supplant lawful authority, thus creating a problem of national concern; "(9) that the existing licensing system under the Federal Firearms Act [former sections 901 to 910 of Title 15 , Commerce and Trade] does not provide adequate license fees or proper standards for the granting or denial of licenses, and that this has led to licenses being issued to persons not reasonably entitled thereto, thus distorting the purposes of the licensing system. "(b) The Congress further hereby declares that the purpose of this title [enacting this chapter and repealing sections 901 to 910 of Title 15 , Commerce and Trade] is to cope with the conditions referred to in the foregoing subsection, and that it is not the purpose of this title [enacting this chapter and repealing sections 901 to 910 of Title 15 ] to place any undue or unnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms appropriate to the purpose of hunting, trap shooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any other lawful activity, and that this title [enacting this chapter and repealing sections 901 to 910 of Title 15 ] is not intended to discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, or provide for the imposition by Federal regulations of any procedures or requirements other than those reasonably necessary to implement and effectuate the provisions of this title [enacting this chapter and repealing sections 901 to 910 of Title 15 ]."

No. 14092, Mar. 14, 2023, 88 F.R. 16527, provided: By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows: Section 1. Policy . Every few days in the United States, we mourn a new mass shooting. Daily acts of gun violence—including community violence, domestic violence, suicide, and accidental shootings—may not always make the evening news, but they too cut lives short and leave survivors and their communities with long-lasting physical and mental wounds. We cannot accept these facts as the enduring reality of life in America. Instead, we must together insist that we have had enough, and that we will no longer allow the interests of the gun manufacturers to win out over the safety of our children and Nation. It is the policy of my Administration that executive departments and agencies (agencies) will pursue every legally available and appropriate action to reduce gun violence. Through this whole-of-government approach, my Administration has made historic progress to save lives. My Administration has taken action to keep guns out of dangerous hands and especially dangerous weapons off of our streets; hold gun traffickers and rogue gun dealers accountable; fund accountable, effective community policing; and invest in community violence interventions and prevention strategies. Last year, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act [ Pub. L. 117–159, see Tables for classification] (the "Act"), the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. The Act provides communities with new tools to combat gun violence, including enhanced gun background checks for individuals under age 21, funding for extreme risk protection orders and other crisis interventions, and increased mental health resources to help children impacted by gun violence heal from the resulting grief and trauma. I continue to call on the Congress to take additional action to reduce gun violence, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring background checks for all gun sales, requiring safe storage of firearms, funding my comprehensive Safer America Plan, and expanding community violence intervention and prevention strategies. In the meantime, my Administration will continue to do all that we can, within existing authority, to make our communities safer. Sec. 2. Implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act . The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each submit a report to the President within 60 days of the date of this order [Mar. 14, 2023] describing what actions their respective agencies have taken to implement the Act, data and analysis regarding the use and early effects of the Act, and additional steps their respective agencies will take to maximize the benefits of the Act. These reports shall include a plan for increasing public awareness and use of resources made available by the Act. Sec. 3. Additional Agency Actions to Reduce Gun Violence . (a) The Attorney General shall develop and implement a plan to: (i) clarify the definition of who is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms, and thus required to become Federal firearms licensees (FFLs), in order to increase compliance with the Federal background check requirement for firearm sales, including by considering a rulemaking, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law; (ii) prevent former FFLs whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered from continuing to engage in the business of dealing in firearms; (iii) publicly release, to the fullest extent permissible by law, inspection reports of FFL dealers cited for violations of the law; and (iv) support efforts to modernize and make permanent the Undetectable Firearms Act [of 1988] ([enacting] 18 U.S.C. 922(p) ). (b) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall expand existing Federal campaigns and other efforts to promote safe storage of firearms. (c) The Secretary of Defense; the Attorney General; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; and the Secretary of Education shall undertake efforts to encourage effective use of extreme risk protection orders ("red flag" laws), partnering with law enforcement, health care providers, educators, and other community leaders. (d) The Attorney General; the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Surgeon General of the United States; the Secretary of Education; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall develop a proposal for the President, and submit it no later than September 15, 2023, on how the Federal Government can better support the recovery, mental health, and other needs of survivors of gun violence, families of victims and survivors of gun violence, first responders to incidents of gun violence, and communities affected by gun violence. The proposal should draw on existing evidence, where available, and take into account how to address needs in both the immediate aftermath of mass shootings and in the years following such events. The proposal should recommend any additional executive branch coordination and additional resources or authorities from the Congress needed to implement the proposal, as well as how agencies will assess the outcomes for the activities implemented. (e) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop and implement principles to further firearm and public safety practices through the Department of Defense's acquisition of firearms, consistent with applicable law. (f) The heads of Federal law enforcement agencies shall, as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days from the date of this order, ensure that their respective law enforcement components issue National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) submission and utilization policies with requirements that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements of the policy issued by the Department of Justice on December 12, 2022, to ensure the prompt entry of ballistics data recovered in connection with criminal investigations into NIBIN. In consultation with the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense policies may be tailored to address specific operational considerations. (g) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Justice, shall work to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment between FFLs and to improve reporting of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and shippers. (h) The Federal Trade Commission is encouraged to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how such manufacturers market firearms to civilians, including through the use of military imagery. Sec. 4. Definitions . For purposes of this order, the term "Federal law enforcement agency" means an organizational unit or subunit of the executive branch that employs officers who are authorized to make arrests and carry firearms, and that is responsible for the prevention, detection, and investigation of crime or the apprehension of alleged offenders. The term "heads of Federal law enforcement agencies" means the heads of those units or subunits. Sec. 5. General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(2) For purposes of this subsection— (A) the term "firearm" does not include the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (B) the term "major component" means, with respect to a firearm, the barrel, the slide or cylinder, or the frame or receiver of the firearm; and (C) the term "Security Exemplar" means an object, to be fabricated at the direction of the Attorney General, that is— (i) constructed of, during the 12-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this subsection, 3.7 ounces of material type 17–4 PH stainless steel in a shape resembling a handgun; and (ii) suitable for testing and calibrating metal detectors: Provided, however , That at the close of such 12-month period, and at appropriate times thereafter the Attorney General shall promulgate regulations to permit the manufacture, importation, sale, shipment, delivery, possession, transfer, or receipt of firearms previously prohibited under this subparagraph that are as detectable as a "Security Exemplar" which contains 3.7 ounces of material type 17–4 PH stainless steel, in a shape resembling a handgun, or such lesser amount as is detectable in view of advances in state-of-the-art developments in weapons detection technology. (3) Under such rules and regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe, this subsection shall not apply to the manufacture, possession, transfer, receipt, shipment, or delivery of a firearm by a licensed manufacturer or any person acting pursuant to a contract with a licensed manufacturer, for the purpose of examining and testing such firearm to determine whether paragraph (1) applies to such firearm. The Attorney General shall ensure that rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this paragraph do not impair the manufacture of prototype firearms or the development of new technology. (4) The Attorney General shall permit the conditional importation of a firearm by a licensed importer or licensed manufacturer, for examination and testing to determine whether or not the unconditional importation of such firearm would violate this subsection. (5) This subsection shall not apply to any firearm which— (A) has been certified by the Secretary of Defense or the Director of Central Intelligence, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, as necessary for military or intelligence applications; and (B) is manufactured for and sold exclusively to military or intelligence agencies of the United States. (6) This subsection shall not apply with respect to any firearm manufactured in, imported into, or possessed in the United States before the date of the enactment of the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988. (q)(1) The Congress finds and declares that— (A) crime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, is a pervasive, nationwide problem; (B) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate movement of drugs, guns, and criminal gangs; (C) firearms and ammunition move easily in interstate commerce and have been found in increasing numbers in and around schools, as documented in numerous hearings in both the Committee on the Judiciary 3 the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate; (D) in fact, even before the sale of a firearm, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, and the raw materials from which they are made have considerably moved in interstate commerce; (E) while criminals freely move from State to State, ordinary citizens and foreign visitors may fear to travel to or through certain parts of the country due to concern about violent crime and gun violence, and parents may decline to send their children to school for the same reason; (F) the occurrence of violent crime in school zones has resulted in a decline in the quality of education in our country; (G) this decline in the quality of education has an adverse impact on interstate commerce and the foreign commerce of the United States; (H) States, localities, and school systems find it almost impossible to handle gun-related crime by themselves—even States, localities, and school systems that have made strong efforts to prevent, detect, and punish gun-related crime find their efforts unavailing due in part to the failure or inability of other States or localities to take strong measures; and (I) the Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce clause and other provisions of the Constitution, to enact measures to ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation's schools by enactment of this subsection. (2)(A) It shall be unlawful for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone. (B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the possession of a firearm— (i) on private property not part of school grounds; (ii) if the individual possessing the firearm is licensed to do so by the State in which the school zone is located or a political subdivision of the State, and the law of the State or political subdivision requires that, before an individual obtains such a license, the law enforcement authorities of the State or political subdivision verify that the individual is qualified under law to receive the license; (iii) that is— (I) not loaded; and (II) in a locked container, or a locked firearms rack that is on a motor vehicle; (iv) by an individual for use in a program approved by a school in the school zone; (v) by an individual in accordance with a contract entered into between a school in the school zone and the individual or an employer of the individual; (vi) by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity; or (vii) that is unloaded and is possessed by an individual while traversing school premises for the purpose of gaining access to public or private lands open to hunting, if the entry on school premises is authorized by school authorities. (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), it shall be unlawful for any person, knowingly or with reckless disregard for the safety of another, to discharge or attempt to discharge a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce at a place that the person knows is a school zone. (B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the discharge of a firearm— (i) on private property not part of school grounds; (ii) as part of a program approved by a school in the school zone, by an individual who is participating in the program; (iii) by an individual in accordance with a contract entered into between a school in a school zone and the individual or an employer of the individual; or (iv) by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity. (4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preempting or preventing a State or local government from enacting a statute establishing gun free school zones as provided in this subsection. (r) It shall be unlawful for any person to assemble from imported parts any semiautomatic rifle or any shotgun which is identical to any rifle or shotgun prohibited from importation under section 925(d)(3) of this chapter as not being particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes except that this subsection shall not apply to— (1) the assembly of any such rifle or shotgun for sale or distribution by a licensed manufacturer to the United States or any department or agency thereof or to any State or any department, agency, or political subdivision thereof; or (2) the assembly of any such rifle or shotgun for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Attorney General. (s)(1) Beginning on the date that is 90 days after the date of enactment of this subsection and ending on the day before the date that is 60 months after such date of enactment, it shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun (other than the return of a handgun to the person from whom it was received) to an individual who is not licensed under section 923, unless— (A) after the most recent proposal of such transfer by the transferee— (i) the transferor has— (I) received from the transferee a statement of the transferee containing the information described in paragraph (3); (II) verified the identity of the transferee by examining the identification document presented; (III) within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the statement, provided notice of the contents of the statement to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee; and (IV) within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the statement, transmitted a copy of the statement to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee; and (ii)(I) 5 business days (meaning days on which State offices are open) have elapsed from the date the transferor furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the chief law enforcement officer, during which period the transferor has not received information from the chief law enforcement officer that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee would be in violation of Federal, State, or local law; or (II) the transferor has received notice from the chief law enforcement officer that the officer has no information indicating that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee would violate Federal, State, or local law; (B) the transferee has presented to the transferor a written statement, issued by the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee during the 10-day period ending on the date of the most recent proposal of such transfer by the transferee, stating that the transferee requires access to a handgun because of a threat to the life of the transferee or of any member of the household of the transferee; (C)(i) the transferee has presented to the transferor a permit that— (I) allows the transferee to possess or acquire a handgun; and (II) was issued not more than 5 years earlier by the State in which the transfer is to take place; and (ii) the law of the State provides that such a permit is to be issued only after an authorized government official has verified that the information available to such official does not indicate that possession of a handgun by the transferee would be in violation of the law; (D) the law of the State requires that, before any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer completes the transfer of a handgun to an individual who is not licensed under section 923, an authorized government official verify that the information available to such official does not indicate that possession of a handgun by the transferee would be in violation of law; (E) the Attorney General has approved the transfer under section 5812 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or (F) on application of the transferor, the Attorney General has certified that compliance with subparagraph (A)(i)(III) is impracticable because— (i) the ratio of the number of law enforcement officers of the State in which the transfer is to occur to the number of square miles of land area of the State does not exceed 0.0025; (ii) the business premises of the transferor at which the transfer is to occur are extremely remote in relation to the chief law enforcement officer; and (iii) there is an absence of telecommunications facilities in the geographical area in which the business premises are located. (2) A chief law enforcement officer to whom a transferor has provided notice pursuant to paragraph (1)(A)(i)(III) shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain within 5 business days whether receipt or possession would be in violation of the law, including research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems are available and in a national system designated by the Attorney General. (3) The statement referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I) shall contain only— (A) the name, address, and date of birth appearing on a valid identification document (as defined in section 1028(d)(1) 4 ) of the transferee containing a photograph of the transferee and a description of the identification used; (B) a statement that the transferee— (i) is not under indictment for, and has not been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year, and has not been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence; (ii) is not a fugitive from justice; (iii) is not an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act); (iv) has not been adjudicated as a mental defective or been committed to a mental institution; (v) is not an alien who— (I) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or (II) subject to subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26) )); (vi) has not been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions; and (vii) is not a person who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced such citizenship; (C) the date the statement is made; and (D) notice that the transferee intends to obtain a handgun from the transferor. (4) Any transferor of a handgun who, after such transfer, receives a report from a chief law enforcement officer containing information that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee violates Federal, State, or local law shall, within 1 business day after receipt of such request, communicate any information related to the transfer that the transferor has about the transfer and the transferee to— (A) the chief law enforcement officer of the place of business of the transferor; and (B) the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee. (5) Any transferor who receives information, not otherwise available to the public, in a report under this subsection shall not disclose such information except to the transferee, to law enforcement authorities, or pursuant to the direction of a court of law. (6)(A) Any transferor who sells, delivers, or otherwise transfers a handgun to a transferee shall retain the copy of the statement of the transferee with respect to the handgun transaction, and shall retain evidence that the transferor has complied with subclauses (III) and (IV) of paragraph (1)(A)(i) with respect to the statement. (B) Unless the chief law enforcement officer to whom a statement is transmitted under paragraph (1)(A)(i)(IV) determines that a transaction would violate Federal, State, or local law— (i) the officer shall, within 20 business days after the date the transferee made the statement on the basis of which the notice was provided, destroy the statement, any record containing information derived from the statement, and any record created as a result of the notice required by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(III); (ii) the information contained in the statement shall not be conveyed to any person except a person who has a need to know in order to carry out this subsection; and (iii) the information contained in the statement shall not be used for any purpose other than to carry out this subsection. (C) If a chief law enforcement officer determines that an individual is ineligible to receive a handgun and the individual requests the officer to provide the reason for such determination, the officer shall provide such reasons to the individual in writing within 20 business days after receipt of the request. (7) A chief law enforcement officer or other person responsible for providing criminal history background information pursuant to this subsection shall not be liable in an action at law for damages— (A) for failure to prevent the sale or transfer of a handgun to a person whose receipt or possession of the handgun is unlawful under this section; or (B) for preventing such a sale or transfer to a person who may lawfully receive or possess a handgun. (8) For purposes of this subsection, the term "chief law enforcement officer" means the chief of police, the sheriff, or an equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual. (9) The Attorney General shall take necessary actions to ensure that the provisions of this subsection are published and disseminated to licensed dealers, law enforcement officials, and the public.

(4) If the national instant criminal background check system notifies the licensee that the information available to the system does not demonstrate that the transfer of a firearm to or receipt of a firearm by such other person would violate subsection (d), (g), or (n) (as applicable) or State 5 local, or Tribal law, and the licensee transfers a firearm to such other person, the licensee shall include in the record of the transfer the unique identification number provided by the system with respect to the transfer. (5) If the licensee knowingly transfers a firearm to such other person and knowingly fails to comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to the transfer and, at the time such other person most recently proposed the transfer, the national instant criminal background check system was operating and information was available to the system demonstrating that transfer of a firearm to or receipt of a firearm by such other person would violate subsection (d), (g), or (n) (as applicable) of this section or State 5 local, or Tribal law, the Attorney General may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend for not more than 6 months or revoke any license issued to the licensee under section 923, and may impose on the licensee a civil fine of not more than $5,000. (6) Neither a local government nor an employee of the Federal Government or of any State or local government, responsible for providing information to the national instant criminal background check system shall be liable in an action at law for damages— (A) for failure to prevent the sale or transfer of a firearm to a person whose receipt or possession of the firearm is unlawful under this section; or (B) for preventing such a sale or transfer to a person who may lawfully receive or possess a firearm.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer from maintaining and disposing of a personal collection of firearms, subject only to such restrictions as apply in this chapter to dispositions by a person other than a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer. If any firearm is so disposed of by a licensee within one year after its transfer from his business inventory into such licensee's personal collection or if such disposition or any other acquisition is made for the purpose of willfully evading the restrictions placed upon licensees by this chapter, then such firearm shall be deemed part of such licensee's business inventory, except that any licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer who has maintained a firearm as part of a personal collection for one year and who sells or otherwise disposes of such firearm shall record the description of the firearm in a bound volume, containing the name and place of residence and date of birth of the transferee if the transferee is an individual, or the identity and principal and local places of business of the transferee if the transferee is a corporation or other business entity: Provided , That no other recordkeeping shall be required.

(2) The Attorney General must approve or deny an application for a license within the 60-day period beginning on the date it is received. If the Attorney General fails to act within such period, the applicant may file an action under section 1361 of title 28 to compel the Attorney General to act. If the Attorney General approves an applicant's application, such applicant shall be issued a license upon the payment of the prescribed fee. (e) The Attorney General may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, revoke any license issued under this section if the holder of such license has willfully violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation prescribed by the Attorney General under this chapter or fails to have secure gun storage or safety devices available at any place in which firearms are sold under the license to persons who are not licensees (except that in any case in which a secure gun storage or safety device is temporarily unavailable because of theft, casualty loss, consumer sales, backorders from a manufacturer, or any other similar reason beyond the control of the licensee, the dealer shall not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make available such a device). The Attorney General may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, revoke the license of a dealer who willfully transfers armor piercing ammunition. The Secretary's 1 action under this subsection may be reviewed only as provided in subsection (f) of this section. (f)(1) Any person whose application for a license is denied and any holder of a license which is revoked shall receive a written notice from the Attorney General stating specifically the grounds upon which the application was denied or upon which the license was revoked. Any notice of a revocation of a license shall be given to the holder of such license before the effective date of the revocation. (2) If the Attorney General denies an application for, or revokes, a license, he shall, upon request by the aggrieved party, promptly hold a hearing to review his denial or revocation. In the case of a revocation of a license, the Attorney General shall upon the request of the holder of the license stay the effective date of the revocation. A hearing held under this paragraph shall be held at a location convenient to the aggrieved party. (3) If after a hearing held under paragraph (2) the Attorney General decides not to reverse his decision to deny an application or revoke a license, the Attorney General shall give notice of his decision to the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party may at any time within sixty days after the date notice was given under this paragraph file a petition with the United States district court for the district in which he resides or has his principal place of business for a de novo judicial review of such denial or revocation. In a proceeding conducted under this subsection, the court may consider any evidence submitted by the parties to the proceeding whether or not such evidence was considered at the hearing held under paragraph (2). If the court decides that the Attorney General was not authorized to deny the application or to revoke the license, the court shall order the Attorney General to take such action as may be necessary to comply with the judgment of the court. (4) If criminal proceedings are instituted against a licensee alleging any violation of this chapter or of rules or regulations prescribed under this chapter, and the licensee is acquitted of such charges, or such proceedings are terminated, other than upon motion of the Government before trial upon such charges, the Attorney General shall be absolutely barred from denying or revoking any license granted under this chapter where such denial or revocation is based in whole or in part on the facts which form the basis of such criminal charges. No proceedings for the revocation of a license shall be instituted by the Attorney General more than one year after the filing of the indictment or information. (g)(1)(A) Each licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, and licensed dealer shall maintain such records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe. Such importers, manufacturers, and dealers shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section. The Attorney General, when he has reasonable cause to believe a violation of this chapter has occurred and that evidence thereof may be found on such premises, may, upon demonstrating such cause before a Federal magistrate judge and securing from such magistrate judge a warrant authorizing entry, enter during business hours the premises (including places of storage) of any licensed firearms importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, licensed collector, or any licensed importer or manufacturer of ammunition, for the purpose of inspecting or examining— (i) any records or documents required to be kept by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector under this chapter or rules or regulations under this chapter, and (ii) any firearms or ammunition kept or stored by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, at such premises. (B) The Attorney General may inspect or examine the inventory and records of a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer without such reasonable cause or warrant— (i) in the course of a reasonable inquiry during the course of a criminal investigation of a person or persons other than the licensee; (ii) for ensuring compliance with the record keeping requirements of this chapter— (I) not more than once during any 12-month period; or (II) at any time with respect to records relating to a firearm involved in a criminal investigation that is traced to the licensee; or (iii) when such inspection or examination may be required for determining the disposition of one or more particular firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation. (C) The Attorney General may inspect the inventory and records of a licensed collector without such reasonable cause or warrant— (i) for ensuring compliance with the record keeping requirements of this chapter not more than once during any twelve-month period; or (ii) when such inspection or examination may be required for determining the disposition of one or more particular firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation. (D) At the election of a licensed collector, the annual inspection of records and inventory permitted under this paragraph shall be performed at the office of the Attorney General designated for such inspections which is located in closest proximity to the premises where the inventory and records of such licensed collector are maintained. The inspection and examination authorized by this paragraph shall not be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to seize any records or other documents other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law. If the Attorney General seizes such records or documents, copies shall be provided the licensee within a reasonable time. The Attorney General may make available to any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency any information which he may obtain by reason of this chapter with respect to the identification of persons prohibited from purchasing or receiving firearms or ammunition who have purchased or received firearms or ammunition, together with a description of such firearms or ammunition, and he may provide information to the extent such information may be contained in the records required to be maintained by this chapter, when so requested by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency. (2) Each licensed collector shall maintain in a bound volume the nature of which the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, records of the receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms. Such records shall include the name and address of any person to whom the collector sells or otherwise disposes of a firearm. Such collector shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section. (3)(A) Each licensee shall prepare a report of multiple sales or other dispositions whenever the licensee sells or otherwise disposes of, at one time or during any five consecutive business days, two or more pistols, or revolvers, or any combination of pistols and revolvers totalling two or more, to an unlicensed person. The report shall be prepared on a form specified by the Attorney General and forwarded to the office specified thereon and to the department of State police or State law enforcement agency of the State or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction in which the sale or other disposition took place, not later than the close of business on the day that the multiple sale or other disposition occurs. (B) Except in the case of forms and contents thereof regarding a purchaser who is prohibited by subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of this title from receipt of a firearm, the department of State police or State law enforcement agency or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction shall not disclose any such form or the contents thereof to any person or entity, and shall destroy each such form and any record of the contents thereof no more than 20 days from the date such form is received. No later than the date that is 6 months after the effective date of this subparagraph, and at the end of each 6-month period thereafter, the department of State police or State law enforcement agency or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction shall certify to the Attorney General of the United States that no disclosure contrary to this subparagraph has been made and that all forms and any record of the contents thereof have been destroyed as provided in this subparagraph. (4) Where a firearms or ammunition business is discontinued and succeeded by a new licensee, the records required to be kept by this chapter shall appropriately reflect such facts and shall be delivered to the successor. Where discontinuance of the business is absolute, such records shall be delivered within thirty days after the business discontinuance to the Attorney General. However, where State law or local ordinance requires the delivery of records to other responsible authority, the Attorney General may arrange for the delivery of such records to such other responsible authority. (5)(A) Each licensee shall, when required by letter issued by the Attorney General, and until notified to the contrary in writing by the Attorney General, submit on a form specified by the Attorney General, for periods and at the times specified in such letter, all record information required to be kept by this chapter or such lesser record information as the Attorney General in such letter may specify. (B) The Attorney General may authorize such record information to be submitted in a manner other than that prescribed in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph when it is shown by a licensee that an alternate method of reporting is reasonably necessary and will not unduly hinder the effective administration of this chapter. A licensee may use an alternate method of reporting if the licensee describes the proposed alternate method of reporting and the need therefor in a letter application submitted to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General approves such alternate method of reporting. (6) Each licensee shall report the theft or loss of a firearm from the licensee's inventory or collection, within 48 hours after the theft or loss is discovered, to the Attorney General and to the appropriate local authorities. (7) Each licensee shall respond immediately to, and in no event later than 24 hours after the receipt of, a request by the Attorney General for information contained in the records required to be kept by this chapter as may be required for determining the disposition of 1 or more firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation. The requested information shall be provided orally or in writing, as the Attorney General may require. The Attorney General shall implement a system whereby the licensee can positively identify and establish that an individual requesting information via telephone is employed by and authorized by the agency to request such information. (h) Licenses issued under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall be kept posted and kept available for inspection on the premises covered by the license. (i) Licensed importers and licensed manufacturers shall identify by means of a serial number engraved or cast on the receiver or frame of the weapon, in such manner as the Attorney General shall by regulations prescribe, each firearm imported or manufactured by such importer or manufacturer. (j) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may, under rules or regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, conduct business temporarily at a location other than the location specified on the license if such temporary location is the location for a gun show or event sponsored by any national, State, or local organization, or any affiliate of any such organization devoted to the collection, competitive use, or other sporting use of firearms in the community, and such location is in the State which is specified on the license. Records of receipt and disposition of firearms transactions conducted at such temporary location shall include the location of the sale or other disposition and shall be entered in the permanent records of the licensee and retained on the location specified on the license. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize any licensee to conduct business in or from any motorized or towed vehicle. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a separate fee shall not be required of a licensee with respect to business conducted under this subsection. Any inspection or examination of inventory or records under this chapter by the Attorney General at such temporary location shall be limited to inventory consisting of, or records relating to, firearms held or disposed at such temporary location. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Attorney General to inspect or examine the inventory or records of a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer at any location other than the location specified on the license. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to diminish in any manner any right to display, sell, or otherwise dispose of firearms or ammunition, which is in effect before the date of the enactment of the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, including the right of a licensee to conduct "curios or relics" firearms transfers and business away from their business premises with another licensee without regard as to whether the location of where the business is conducted is located in the State specified on the license of either licensee. (k) Licensed importers and licensed manufacturers shall mark all armor piercing projectiles and packages containing such projectiles for distribution in the manner prescribed by the Attorney General by regulation. The Attorney General shall furnish information to each dealer licensed under this chapter defining which projectiles are considered armor piercing ammunition as defined in section 921(a)(17)(B). (l) The Attorney General shall notify the chief law enforcement officer in the appropriate State and local jurisdictions of the names and addresses of all persons in the State to whom a firearms license is issued.

Law enforcement agencies may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced are used in crime. "(2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected do not constitute a random sample and should not be considered representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe.

(E) With respect to an offense listed in subsection (a)(1)(D) committed for the purpose of executing or attempting to execute any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent statements, pretenses, representations or promises, the gross receipts of such an offense shall include all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which thereby is obtained, directly or indirectly.

(H) Any property, real or personal, involved in a violation or attempted violation, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to a violation, of section 2339C of this title . (I) Any property, real or personal, that is involved in a violation or attempted violation, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to a prohibition imposed pursuant to section 104(a) of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016. (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "proceeds" is defined as follows: (A) In cases involving illegal goods, illegal services, unlawful activities, and telemarketing and health care fraud schemes, the term "proceeds" means property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly, as the result of the commission of the offense giving rise to forfeiture, and any property traceable thereto, and is not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense. (B) In cases involving lawful goods or lawful services that are sold or provided in an illegal manner, the term "proceeds" means the amount of money acquired through the illegal transactions resulting in the forfeiture, less the direct costs incurred in providing the goods or services. The claimant shall have the burden of proof with respect to the issue of direct costs. The direct costs shall not include any part of the overhead expenses of the entity providing the goods or services, or any part of the income taxes paid by the entity. (C) In cases involving fraud in the process of obtaining a loan or extension of credit, the court shall allow the claimant a deduction from the forfeiture to the extent that the loan was repaid, or the debt was satisfied, without any financial loss to the victim. (b)(1) Except as provided in section 985, any property subject to forfeiture to the United States under subsection (a) may be seized by the Attorney General and, in the case of property involved in a violation investigated by the Secretary of the Treasury or the United States Postal Service, the property may also be seized by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Postal Service, respectively. (2) Seizures pursuant to this section shall be made pursuant to a warrant obtained in the same manner as provided for a search warrant under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, except that a seizure may be made without a warrant if— (A) a complaint for forfeiture has been filed in the United States district court and the court issued an arrest warrant in rem pursuant to the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims; (B) there is probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture and— (i) the seizure is made pursuant to a lawful arrest or search; or (ii) another exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement would apply; or (C) the property was lawfully seized by a State or local law enforcement agency and transferred to a Federal agency. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of rule 41(a) 4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a seizure warrant may be issued pursuant to this subsection by a judicial officer in any district in which a forfeiture action against the property may be filed under section 1355(b) of title 28 , and may be executed in any district in which the property is found, or transmitted to the central authority of any foreign state for service in accordance with any treaty or other international agreement. Any motion for the return of property seized under this section shall be filed in the district court in which the seizure warrant was issued or in the district court for the district in which the property was seized. (4)(A) If any person is arrested or charged in a foreign country in connection with an offense that would give rise to the forfeiture of property in the United States under this section or under the Controlled Substances Act, the Attorney General may apply to any Federal judge or magistrate judge in the district in which the property is located for an ex parte order restraining the property subject to forfeiture for not more than 30 days, except that the time may be extended for good cause shown at a hearing conducted in the manner provided in rule 43(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (B) The application for the restraining order shall set forth the nature and circumstances of the foreign charges and the basis for belief that the person arrested or charged has property in the United States that would be subject to forfeiture, and shall contain a statement that the restraining order is needed to preserve the availability of property for such time as is necessary to receive evidence from the foreign country or elsewhere in support of probable cause for the seizure of the property under this subsection. (c) Property taken or detained under this section shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, subject only to the orders and decrees of the court or the official having jurisdiction thereof. Whenever property is seized under this subsection, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, may— (1) place the property under seal; (2) remove the property to a place designated by him; or (3) require that the General Services Administration take custody of the property and remove it, if practicable, to an appropriate location for disposition in accordance with law. (d) For purposes of this section, the provisions of the customs laws relating to the seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture, condemnation of property for violation of the customs laws, the disposition of such property or the proceeds from the sale of such property under this section, the remission or mitigation of such forfeitures, and the compromise of claims ( 19 U.S.C. 1602 et seq. ), insofar as they are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, shall apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been incurred, under this section, except that such duties as are imposed upon the customs officer or any other person with respect to the seizure and forfeiture of property under the customs laws shall be performed with respect to seizures and forfeitures of property under this section by such officers, agents, or other persons as may be authorized or designated for that purpose by the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be. The Attorney General shall have sole responsibility for disposing of petitions for remission or mitigation with respect to property involved in a judicial forfeiture proceeding. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, except section 3 of the Anti Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, is authorized to retain property forfeited pursuant to this section, or to transfer such property on such terms and conditions as he may determine— (1) to any other Federal agency; (2) to any State or local law enforcement agency which participated directly in any of the acts which led to the seizure or forfeiture of the property; (3) in the case of property referred to in subsection (a)(1)(C), to any Federal financial institution regulatory agency— (A) to reimburse the agency for payments to claimants or creditors of the institution; and (B) to reimburse the insurance fund of the agency for losses suffered by the fund as a result of the receivership or liquidation; (4) in the case of property referred to in subsection (a)(1)(C), upon the order of the appropriate Federal financial institution regulatory agency, to the financial institution as restitution, with the value of the property so transferred to be set off against any amount later recovered by the financial institution as compensatory damages in any State or Federal proceeding; (5) in the case of property referred to in subsection (a)(1)(C), to any Federal financial institution regulatory agency, to the extent of the agency's contribution of resources to, or expenses involved in, the seizure and forfeiture, and the investigation leading directly to the seizure and forfeiture, of such property; (6) as restoration to any victim of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture, including, in the case of a money laundering offense, any offense constituting the underlying specified unlawful activity; or (7) In 3 the case of property referred to in subsection (a)(1)(D), to the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other Federal financial institution regulatory agency (as defined in section 8(e)(7)(D) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act). The Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, shall ensure the equitable transfer pursuant to paragraph (2) of any forfeited property to the appropriate State or local law enforcement agency so as to reflect generally the contribution of any such agency participating directly in any of the acts which led to the seizure or forfeiture of such property. A decision by the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service pursuant to paragraph (2) shall not be subject to review. The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of the use of any property the custody of which was transferred pursuant to this section to any non-Federal agency. The Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service may order the discontinuance of any forfeiture proceedings under this section in favor of the institution of forfeiture proceedings by State or local authorities under an appropriate State or local statute. After the filing of a complaint for forfeiture under this section, the Attorney General may seek dismissal of the complaint in favor of forfeiture proceedings under State or local law. Whenever forfeiture proceedings are discontinued by the United States in favor of State or local proceedings, the United States may transfer custody and possession of the seized property to the appropriate State or local official immediately upon the initiation of the proper actions by such officials. Whenever forfeiture proceedings are discontinued by the United States in favor of State or local proceedings, notice shall be sent to all known interested parties advising them of the discontinuance or dismissal. The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of the seizure, detention, and transfer of seized property to State or local officials. The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of a transfer under paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection. (f) All right, title, and interest in property described in subsection (a) of this section shall vest in the United States upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section. (g)(1) Upon the motion of the United States, the court shall stay the civil forfeiture proceeding if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability of the Government to conduct a related criminal investigation or the prosecution of a related criminal case. (2) Upon the motion of a claimant, the court shall stay the civil forfeiture proceeding with respect to that claimant if the court determines that— (A) the claimant is the subject of a related criminal investigation or case; (B) the claimant has standing to assert a claim in the civil forfeiture proceeding; and (C) continuation of the forfeiture proceeding will burden the right of the claimant against self-incrimination in the related investigation or case. (3) With respect to the impact of civil discovery described in paragraphs (1) and (2), the court may determine that a stay is unnecessary if a protective order limiting discovery would protect the interest of one party without unfairly limiting the ability of the opposing party to pursue the civil case. In no case, however, shall the court impose a protective order as an alternative to a stay if the effect of such protective order would be to allow one party to pursue discovery while the other party is substantially unable to do so. (4) In this subsection, the terms "related criminal case" and "related criminal investigation" mean an actual prosecution or investigation in progress at the time at which the request for the stay, or any subsequent motion to lift the stay is made. In determining whether a criminal case or investigation is "related" to a civil forfeiture proceeding, the court shall consider the degree of similarity between the parties, witnesses, facts, and circumstances involved in the two proceedings, without requiring an identity with respect to any one or more factors. (5) In requesting a stay under paragraph (1), the Government may, in appropriate cases, submit evidence ex parte in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect an ongoing criminal investigation or pending criminal trial. (6) Whenever a civil forfeiture proceeding is stayed pursuant to this subsection, the court shall enter any order necessary to preserve the value of the property or to protect the rights of lienholders or other persons with an interest in the property while the stay is in effect. (7) A determination by the court that the claimant has standing to request a stay pursuant to paragraph (2) shall apply only to this subsection and shall not preclude the Government from objecting to the standing of the claimant by dispositive motion or at the time of trial. (h) In addition to the venue provided for in section 1395 of title 28 or any other provision of law, in the case of property of a defendant charged with a violation that is the basis for forfeiture of the property under this section, a proceeding for forfeiture under this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the defendant owning such property is found or in the judicial district in which the criminal prosecution is brought. (i)(1) Whenever property is civilly or criminally forfeited under this chapter, the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury, as the case may be, may transfer the forfeited personal property or the proceeds of the sale of any forfeited personal or real property to any foreign country which participated directly or indirectly in the seizure or forfeiture of the property, if such a transfer— (A) has been agreed to by the Secretary of State; (B) is authorized in an international agreement between the United States and the foreign country; and (C) is made to a country which, if applicable, has been certified under section 481(h) 4 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. A decision by the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to review. The foreign country shall, in the event of a transfer of property or proceeds of sale of property under this subsection, bear all expenses incurred by the United States in the seizure, maintenance, inventory, storage, forfeiture, and disposition of the property, and all transfer costs. The payment of all such expenses, and the transfer of assets pursuant to this paragraph, shall be upon such terms and conditions as the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury may, in his discretion, set. (2) The provisions of this section shall not be construed as limiting or superseding any other authority of the United States to provide assistance to a foreign country in obtaining property related to a crime committed in the foreign country, including property which is sought as evidence of a crime committed in the foreign country. (3) A certified order or judgment of forfeiture by a court of competent jurisdiction of a foreign country concerning property which is the subject of forfeiture under this section and was determined by such court to be the type of property described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, and any certified recordings or transcripts of testimony taken in a foreign judicial proceeding concerning such order or judgment of forfeiture, shall be admissible in evidence in a proceeding brought pursuant to this section. Such certified order or judgment of forfeiture, when admitted into evidence, shall constitute probable cause that the property forfeited by such order or judgment of forfeiture is subject to forfeiture under this section and creates a rebuttable presumption of the forfeitability of such property under this section. (4) A certified order or judgment of conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction of a foreign country concerning an unlawful drug activity which gives rise to forfeiture under this section and any certified recordings or transcripts of testimony taken in a foreign judicial proceeding concerning such order or judgment of conviction shall be admissible in evidence in a proceeding brought pursuant to this section. Such certified order or judgment of conviction, when admitted into evidence, creates a rebuttable presumption that the unlawful drug activity giving rise to forfeiture under this section has occurred. (5) The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the admissibility of any evidence otherwise admissible, nor shall they limit the ability of the United States to establish probable cause that property is subject to forfeiture by any evidence otherwise admissible. (j) For purposes of this section— (1) the term "Attorney General" means the Attorney General or his delegate; and (2) the term "Secretary of the Treasury" means the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. (k) Interbank Accounts.— (1) In general.— (A) In general .—For the purpose of a forfeiture under this section or under the Controlled Substances Act ( 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq. ), if funds are deposited into an account at a foreign financial institution (as defined in section 984(c)(2)(A) of this title ), and that foreign financial institution (as defined in section 984(c)(2)(A) of this title ) has an interbank account in the United States with a covered financial institution (as defined in section 5318(j)(1) of title 31 ), the funds shall be deemed to have been deposited into the interbank account in the United States, and any restraining order, seizure warrant, or arrest warrant in rem regarding the funds may be served on the covered financial institution, and funds in the interbank account, up to the value of the funds deposited into the account at the foreign financial institution (as defined in section 984(c)(2)(A) of this title ), may be restrained, seized, or arrested. (B) Authority to suspend .—The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, may suspend or terminate a forfeiture under this section if the Attorney General determines that a conflict of law exists between the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign financial institution (as defined in section 984(c)(2)(A) of this title ) is located and the laws of the United States with respect to liabilities arising from the restraint, seizure, or arrest of such funds, and that such suspension or termination would be in the interest of justice and would not harm the national interests of the United States. (2) No requirement for government to trace funds .—If a forfeiture action is brought against funds that are restrained, seized, or arrested under paragraph (1), it shall not be necessary for the Government to establish that the funds are directly traceable to the funds that were deposited into the foreign financial institution (as defined in section 984(c)(2)(A) of this title ), nor shall it be necessary for the Government to rely on the application of section 984.

General rules for civil forfeiture proceedings (a) Notice; Claim; Complaint.— (1)(A)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) through (v), in any nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute, with respect to which the Government is required to send written notice to interested parties, such notice shall be sent in a manner to achieve proper notice as soon as practicable, and in no case more than 60 days after the date of the seizure. (ii) No notice is required if, before the 60-day period expires, the Government files a civil judicial forfeiture action against the property and provides notice of that action as required by law. (iii) If, before the 60-day period expires, the Government does not file a civil judicial forfeiture action, but does obtain a criminal indictment containing an allegation that the property is subject to forfeiture, the Government shall either— (I) send notice within the 60 days and continue the nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under this section; or (II) terminate the nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding, and take the steps necessary to preserve its right to maintain custody of the property as provided in the applicable criminal forfeiture statute. (iv) In a case in which the property is seized by a State or local law enforcement agency and turned over to a Federal law enforcement agency for the purpose of forfeiture under Federal law, notice shall be sent not more than 90 days after the date of seizure by the State or local law enforcement agency. (v) If the identity or interest of a party is not determined until after the seizure or turnover but is determined before a declaration of forfeiture is entered, notice shall be sent to such interested party not later than 60 days after the determination by the Government of the identity of the party or the party's interest. (B) A supervisory official in the headquarters office of the seizing agency may extend the period for sending notice under subparagraph (A) for a period not to exceed 30 days (which period may not be further extended except by a court), if the official determines that the conditions in subparagraph (D) are present. (C) Upon motion by the Government, a court may extend the period for sending notice under subparagraph (A) for a period not to exceed 60 days, which period may be further extended by the court for 60-day periods, as necessary, if the court determines, based on a written certification of a supervisory official in the headquarters office of the seizing agency, that the conditions in subparagraph (D) are present. (D) The period for sending notice under this paragraph may be extended only if there is reason to believe that notice may have an adverse result, including— (i) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual; (ii) flight from prosecution; (iii) destruction of or tampering with evidence; (iv) intimidation of potential witnesses; or (v) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial. (E) Each of the Federal seizing agencies conducting nonjudicial forfeitures under this section shall report periodically to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate the number of occasions when an extension of time is granted under subparagraph (B). (F) If the Government does not send notice of a seizure of property in accordance with subparagraph (A) to the person from whom the property was seized, and no extension of time is granted, the Government shall return the property to that person without prejudice to the right of the Government to commence a forfeiture proceeding at a later time. The Government shall not be required to return contraband or other property that the person from whom the property was seized may not legally possess. (2)(A) Any person claiming property seized in a nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute may file a claim with the appropriate official after the seizure. (B) A claim under subparagraph (A) may be filed not later than the deadline set forth in a personal notice letter (which deadline may be not earlier than 35 days after the date the letter is mailed), except that if that letter is not received, then a claim may be filed not later than 30 days after the date of final publication of notice of seizure. (C) A claim shall— (i) identify the specific property being claimed; (ii) state the claimant's interest in such property; and (iii) be made under oath, subject to penalty of perjury. (D) A claim need not be made in any particular form. Each Federal agency conducting nonjudicial forfeitures under this section shall make claim forms generally available on request, which forms shall be written in easily understandable language. (E) Any person may make a claim under subparagraph (A) without posting bond with respect to the property which is the subject of the claim. (3)(A) Not later than 90 days after a claim has been filed, the Government shall file a complaint for forfeiture in the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims or return the property pending the filing of a complaint, except that a court in the district in which the complaint will be filed may extend the period for filing a complaint for good cause shown or upon agreement of the parties. (B) If the Government does not— (i) file a complaint for forfeiture or return the property, in accordance with subparagraph (A); or (ii) before the time for filing a complaint has expired— (I) obtain a criminal indictment containing an allegation that the property is subject to forfeiture; and (II) take the steps necessary to preserve its right to maintain custody of the property as provided in the applicable criminal forfeiture statute, the Government shall promptly release the property pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General, and may not take any further action to effect the civil forfeiture of such property in connection with the underlying offense. (C) In lieu of, or in addition to, filing a civil forfeiture complaint, the Government may include a forfeiture allegation in a criminal indictment. If criminal forfeiture is the only forfeiture proceeding commenced by the Government, the Government's right to continued possession of the property shall be governed by the applicable criminal forfeiture statute. (D) No complaint may be dismissed on the ground that the Government did not have adequate evidence at the time the complaint was filed to establish the forfeitability of the property. (4)(A) In any case in which the Government files in the appropriate United States district court a complaint for forfeiture of property, any person claiming an interest in the seized property may file a claim asserting such person's interest in the property in the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, except that such claim may be filed not later than 30 days after the date of service of the Government's complaint or, as applicable, not later than 30 days after the date of final publication of notice of the filing of the complaint. (B) A person asserting an interest in seized property, in accordance with subparagraph (A), shall file an answer to the Government's complaint for forfeiture not later than 20 days after the date of the filing of the claim. (b) Representation.— (1)(A) If a person with standing to contest the forfeiture of property in a judicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute is financially unable to obtain representation by counsel, and the person is represented by counsel appointed under section 3006A of this title in connection with a related criminal case, the court may authorize counsel to represent that person with respect to the claim. (B) In determining whether to authorize counsel to represent a person under subparagraph (A), the court shall take into account such factors as— (i) the person's standing to contest the forfeiture; and (ii) whether the claim appears to be made in good faith. (2)(A) If a person with standing to contest the forfeiture of property in a judicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute is financially unable to obtain representation by counsel, and the property subject to forfeiture is real property that is being used by the person as a primary residence, the court, at the request of the person, shall insure that the person is represented by an attorney for the Legal Services Corporation with respect to the claim. (B)(i) At appropriate times during a representation under subparagraph (A), the Legal Services Corporation shall submit a statement of reasonable attorney fees and costs to the court. (ii) The court shall enter a judgment in favor of the Legal Services Corporation for reasonable attorney fees and costs submitted pursuant to clause (i) and treat such judgment as payable under section 2465 of title 28, United States Code , regardless of the outcome of the case. (3) The court shall set the compensation for representation under this subsection, which shall be equivalent to that provided for court-appointed representation under section 3006A of this title . (c) Burden of Proof .—In a suit or action brought under any civil forfeiture statute for the civil forfeiture of any property— (1) the burden of proof is on the Government to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture; (2) the Government may use evidence gathered after the filing of a complaint for forfeiture to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that property is subject to forfeiture; and (3) if the Government's theory of forfeiture is that the property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a criminal offense, or was involved in the commission of a criminal offense, the Government shall establish that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense. (d) Innocent Owner Defense.— (1) An innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute. The claimant shall have the burden of proving that the claimant is an innocent owner by a preponderance of the evidence. (2)(A) With respect to a property interest in existence at the time the illegal conduct giving rise to forfeiture took place, the term "innocent owner" means an owner who— (i) did not know of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture; or (ii) upon learning of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, did all that reasonably could be expected under the circumstances to terminate such use of the property. (B)(i) For the purposes of this paragraph, ways in which a person may show that such person did all that reasonably could be expected may include demonstrating that such person, to the extent permitted by law— (I) gave timely notice to an appropriate law enforcement agency of information that led the person to know the conduct giving rise to a forfeiture would occur or has occurred; and (II) in a timely fashion revoked or made a good faith attempt to revoke permission for those engaging in such conduct to use the property or took reasonable actions in consultation with a law enforcement agency to discourage or prevent the illegal use of the property. (ii) A person is not required by this subparagraph to take steps that the person reasonably believes would be likely to subject any person (other than the person whose conduct gave rise to the forfeiture) to physical danger. (3)(A) With respect to a property interest acquired after the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture has taken place, the term "innocent owner" means a person who, at the time that person acquired the interest in the property— (i) was a bona fide purchaser or seller for value (including a purchaser or seller of goods or services for value); and (ii) did not know and was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture. (B) An otherwise valid claim under subparagraph (A) shall not be denied on the ground that the claimant gave nothing of value in exchange for the property if— (i) the property is the primary residence of the claimant; (ii) depriving the claimant of the property would deprive the claimant of the means to maintain reasonable shelter in the community for the claimant and all dependents residing with the claimant; (iii) the property is not, and is not traceable to, the proceeds of any criminal offense; and (iv) the claimant acquired his or her interest in the property through marriage, divorce, or legal separation, or the claimant was the spouse or legal dependent of a person whose death resulted in the transfer of the property to the claimant through inheritance or probate, except that the court shall limit the value of any real property interest for which innocent ownership is recognized under this subparagraph to the value necessary to maintain reasonable shelter in the community for such claimant and all dependents residing with the claimant. (4) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, no person may assert an ownership interest under this subsection in contraband or other property that it is illegal to possess. (5) If the court determines, in accordance with this section, that an innocent owner has a partial interest in property otherwise subject to forfeiture, or a joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety in such property, the court may enter an appropriate order— (A) severing the property; (B) transferring the property to the Government with a provision that the Government compensate the innocent owner to the extent of his or her ownership interest once a final order of forfeiture has been entered and the property has been reduced to liquid assets; or (C) permitting the innocent owner to retain the property subject to a lien in favor of the Government to the extent of the forfeitable interest in the property. (6) In this subsection, the term "owner"— (A) means a person with an ownership interest in the specific property sought to be forfeited, including a leasehold, lien, mortgage, recorded security interest, or valid assignment of an ownership interest; and (B) does not include— (i) a person with only a general unsecured interest in, or claim against, the property or estate of another; (ii) a bailee unless the bailor is identified and the bailee shows a colorable legitimate interest in the property seized; or (iii) a nominee who exercises no dominion or control over the property. (e) Motion To Set Aside Forfeiture.— (1) Any person entitled to written notice in any nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute who does not receive such notice may file a motion to set aside a declaration of forfeiture with respect to that person's interest in the property, which motion shall be granted if— (A) the Government knew, or reasonably should have known, of the moving party's interest and failed to take reasonable steps to provide such party with notice; and (B) the moving party did not know or have reason to know of the seizure within sufficient time to file a timely claim. (2)(A) Notwithstanding the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, if the court grants a motion under paragraph (1), the court shall set aside the declaration of forfeiture as to the interest of the moving party without prejudice to the right of the Government to commence a subsequent forfeiture proceeding as to the interest of the moving party. (B) Any proceeding described in subparagraph (A) shall be commenced— (i) if nonjudicial, within 60 days of the entry of the order granting the motion; or (ii) if judicial, within 6 months of the entry of the order granting the motion. (3) A motion under paragraph (1) may be filed not later than 5 years after the date of final publication of notice of seizure of the property. (4) If, at the time a motion made under paragraph (1) is granted, the forfeited property has been disposed of by the Government in accordance with law, the Government may institute proceedings against a substitute sum of money equal to the value of the moving party's interest in the property at the time the property was disposed of. (5) A motion filed under this subsection shall be the exclusive remedy for seeking to set aside a declaration of forfeiture under a civil forfeiture statute. (f) Release Of Seized Property.— (1) A claimant under subsection (a) is entitled to immediate release of seized property if— (A) the claimant has a possessory interest in the property; (B) the claimant has sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will be available at the time of the trial; (C) the continued possession by the Government pending the final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as preventing the functioning of a business, preventing an individual from working, or leaving an individual homeless; (D) the claimant's likely hardship from the continued possession by the Government of the seized property outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceeding; and (E) none of the conditions set forth in paragraph (8) applies. (2) A claimant seeking release of property under this subsection must request possession of the property from the appropriate official, and the request must set forth the basis on which the requirements of paragraph (1) are met. (3)(A) If not later than 15 days after the date of a request under paragraph (2) the property has not been released, the claimant may file a petition in the district court in which the complaint has been filed or, if no complaint has been filed, in the district court in which the seizure warrant was issued or in the district court for the district in which the property was seized. (B) The petition described in subparagraph (A) shall set forth— (i) the basis on which the requirements of paragraph (1) are met; and (ii) the steps the claimant has taken to secure release of the property from the appropriate official. (4) If the Government establishes that the claimant's claim is frivolous, the court shall deny the petition. In responding to a petition under this subsection on other grounds, the Government may in appropriate cases submit evidence ex parte in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect an ongoing criminal investigation or pending criminal trial. (5) The court shall render a decision on a petition filed under paragraph (3) not later than 30 days after the date of the filing, unless such 30-day limitation is extended by consent of the parties or by the court for good cause shown. (6) If— (A) a petition is filed under paragraph (3); and (B) the claimant demonstrates that the requirements of paragraph (1) have been met, the district court shall order that the property be returned to the claimant, pending completion of proceedings by the Government to obtain forfeiture of the property. (7) If the court grants a petition under paragraph (3)— (A) the court may enter any order necessary to ensure that the value of the property is maintained while the forfeiture action is pending, including— (i) permitting the inspection, photographing, and inventory of the property; (ii) fixing a bond in accordance with rule E(5) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims; and (iii) requiring the claimant to obtain or maintain insurance on the subject property; and (B) the Government may place a lien against the property or file a lis pendens to ensure that the property is not transferred to another person. (8) This subsection shall not apply if the seized property— (A) is contraband, currency, or other monetary instrument, or electronic funds unless such currency or other monetary instrument or electronic funds constitutes the assets of a legitimate business which has been seized; (B) is to be used as evidence of a violation of the law; (C) by reason of design or other characteristic, is particularly suited for use in illegal activities; or (D) is likely to be used to commit additional criminal acts if returned to the claimant. (g) Proportionality.— (1) The claimant under subsection (a)(4) may petition the court to determine whether the forfeiture was constitutionally excessive. (2) In making this determination, the court shall compare the forfeiture to the gravity of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture. (3) The claimant shall have the burden of establishing that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional by a preponderance of the evidence at a hearing conducted by the court without a jury. (4) If the court finds that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the offense it shall reduce or eliminate the forfeiture as necessary to avoid a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. (h) Civil Fine.— (1) In any civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute in which the Government prevails, if the court finds that the claimant's assertion of an interest in the property was frivolous, the court may impose a civil fine on the claimant of an amount equal to 10 percent of the value of the forfeited property, but in no event shall the fine be less than $250 or greater than $5,000. (2) Any civil fine imposed under this subsection shall not preclude the court from imposing sanctions under rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (3) In addition to the limitations of section 1915 of title 28, United States Code , in no event shall a prisoner file a claim under a civil forfeiture statute or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding based on a civil forfeiture statute if the prisoner has, on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous or malicious, unless the prisoner shows extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. (i) Civil Forfeiture Statute Defined .—In this section, the term "civil forfeiture statute"— (1) means any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense; and (2) does not include— (A) the Tariff Act of 1930 or any other provision of law codified in title 19; (B) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; (C) the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq. ); (D) the Trading with the Enemy Act ( 50 U.S.C. 4301 et seq. ), the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ( 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. ), or the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016; 1 or (E) section 1 of title VI of the Act of June 15, 1917 ( 40 Stat. 233 ; 22 U.S.C. 401 ). (j) Restraining Orders; Protective Orders.— (1) Upon application of the United States, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, create receiverships, appoint conservators, custodians, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to seize, secure, maintain, or preserve the availability of property subject to civil forfeiture— (A) upon the filing of a civil forfeiture complaint alleging that the property with respect to which the order is sought is subject to civil forfeiture; or (B) prior to the filing of such a complaint, if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that— (i) there is a substantial probability that the United States will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and (ii) the need to preserve the availability of the property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered. (2) An order entered pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be effective for not more than 90 days, unless extended by the court for good cause shown, or unless a complaint described in paragraph (1)(A) has been filed. (3) A temporary restraining order under this subsection may be entered upon application of the United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing when a complaint has not yet been filed with respect to the property, if the United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought is subject to civil forfeiture and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture. Such a temporary order shall expire not more than 14 days after the date on which it is entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period. A hearing requested concerning an order entered under this paragraph shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the expiration of the temporary order. (4) The court may receive and consider, at a hearing held pursuant to this subsection, evidence and information that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. (Added and amended Pub.

(2) The filing of a lis pendens and the execution of a writ of entry for the purpose of conducting an inspection and inventory of the property shall not be considered a seizure under this subsection.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii), to establish exigent circumstances, the Government shall show that less restrictive measures such as a lis pendens, restraining order, or bond would not suffice to protect the Government's interests in preventing the sale, destruction, or continued unlawful use of the real property. (e) If the court authorizes a seizure of real property under subsection (d)(1)(B)(ii), it shall conduct a prompt post-seizure hearing during which the property owner shall have an opportunity to contest the basis for the seizure. (f) This section— (1) applies only to civil forfeitures of real property and interests in real property; (2) does not apply to forfeitures of the proceeds of the sale of such property or interests, or of money or other assets intended to be used to acquire such property or interests; and (3) shall not affect the authority of the court to enter a restraining order relating to real property.

As used in this section, the term "national bank" is synonymous with "national banking association"; "member bank" means and includes any national bank, state bank, or bank or trust company, which has become a member of one of the Federal Reserve banks; "insured bank" includes any state bank, banking association, trust company, savings bank, or other banking institution, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and the term "branch or agency of a foreign bank" means a branch or agency described in section 20(9) of this title . For purposes of this section, the term "depository institution holding company" has the meaning given such term in section 3(w)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 592, 597 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ( R.S. §5209 ; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22(i) as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, §3, 48 Stat. 1107 ; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, §7, 40 Stat. 972 ; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §316, 49 Stat. 712 ). (See reviser's note under section 656 of this title for comprehensive statement of reasons for separating section 592 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, into three revised sections, and section 597 thereof into two revised sections, with the consequent extensive changes in phraseology, style, and arrangement.) In this section, national bank receivers and Federal reserve agents were not included in the initial enumeration of persons at whom the act is directed, since the provisions of this section, unlike section 656 of this title , are not directed at such receivers and agents. No changes of meaning or substance were made, except that, like said section 656 of this title , the different punishment provisions were reconciled, and one uniform punishment provision was adopted. The words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor" were omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of a misdemeanor in section 1 of this title . The words "and upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured. Since section 3231 of this title gives the district court jurisdiction of criminal prosecutions, the words "in any district court of the United States" were omitted as unnecessary.

Each of the eleven sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions relating to embezzlement, false entries, and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligations with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations. These were divided and the false entry and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligation provisions of all, form the basis of this section. The remaining provisions of each section, relating to embezzlement and misapplication, form the basis for section 657 of this title . That portion of said section 616(c) of title 15 , relating to disclosure of information, forms the basis for section 1904 of this title . Each revised section condenses and simplifies the constituent provisions without change of substance except as herein indicated. The punishment provisions in each section were the same except that in section 1026(b) of title 7 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., and sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., the maximum fine was $5,000. This consolidated section adopts the $10,000 maximum fine provided by the seven other sections. References to persons aiding or abetting contained in sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title . The term "receiver," used in sections 1121 and 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., with reference to Federal intermediate credit banks and agricultural credit corporations, was omitted as this term is undoubtedly embraced in the phrase "or connected in any capacity with." The term "or of any department or agency of the United States" was inserted in order to clarify the sweeping provisions against fraudulent acts and to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitions of "department" and "agency" in section 6 of this title .) Words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor", contained in section 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title . Words "and upon conviction", contained in section 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction. Words "in any district court of the United States", contained in section 1311 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, because section 3231 of this title confers jurisdiction on the Federal district courts of all crimes and offenses defined in this title. The conspiracy provisions of section 1138d(f) of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were not added to this consolidated section for reasons stated in reviser's note under section 493 of this title . (See also reviser's note under section 371 of this title .) 1949 Act [Section 20] conforms section 1006 of title 18 , U.S.C., to administrative practice which in turn was modified to comply with congressional policy.

L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 1423–1425 of title 42 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Public Health and Welfare ( Sept. 1, 1937, ch. 896, §§23–25, 50 Stat. 899 ). Three sections were consolidated with changes of phraseology and arrangement necessary to effect consolidation. Words "upon conviction thereof", in each section were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction. The provisions of section 1424 of title 42 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Public Health and Welfare, relating to conspiracy were omitted as inconsistent with the general conspiracy statute, section 371 of this title , both as to punishment and allegation and proof of an overt act. (See reviser's note under section 493 of this title .) Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000" in last par. 1967 — Pub. L. 90–19 substituted "Department of Housing and Urban Development" for "Public Housing Administration" in section catchline and text, and "Department" for "Administration" wherever appearing in text. 1951 —Act Oct. 31, 1951, substituted "Public Housing Administration" for "United States Housing Authority" in section catchline and text, and "Administration" for "Authority", wherever appearing in text. §1013.

( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 752 ; Pub. L. 97–297, §4(a), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1318 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §§330004(8), 330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2141 , 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 985, 1127, and 1317 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ( July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §31, fifth paragraph, 39 Stat. 384 ; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §211(g), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, §2, 42 Stat. 1461 ; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, §216(g), 42 Stat. 1473 ). This section condenses and simplifies sections 985, 1127, and 1317 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, each of which contained similar provisions and similar language. The punishment provisions of all three sections were the same. References to "chapter" and "subchapter" were omitted and words describing the various types of banks or organizations to which said sections 985, 1127, and 1317 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, related, were inserted in lieu. This necessitated some rephrasing and transposition of phrases, but without change of meaning or substance. Words "upon conviction" which were contained in sections 1127 and 1317 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction. Changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322, §330016(1)(G), substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $500". Pub. L. 103–322, §330004(8), struck out ", or by any National Agricultural Credit Corporation" after "credit bank or banks". 1982 — Pub. L. 97–297 struck out ", or by any joint-stock land bank or banks" after "issued by any Federal land bank or banks". §1014.

The term "State-chartered credit union" includes a credit union chartered under the laws of a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.

Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on sections 1026(a) and 1514(a) of title 7 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, sections 596, 981, 1122, 1123, 1138d(a), 1248, 1312, 1313, 1441(a), and 1467(a), of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(a) of title 15 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22(h), as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, §3, 48 Stat. 1107 ; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §31, first paragraph, 39 Stat. 382 ; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §211(b), (c), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, §2, 42 Stat. 1460 ; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, §§209(h), 216(b), (c), 42 Stat. 1468 , 1472 ; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16 (a), 47 Stat. 11 ; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21(a), 47 Stat. 738 ; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, §8(a), 48 Stat. 134 ; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64(a), 48 Stat. 267 ; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, §13, 48 Stat. 347 ; June 3, 1935, ch. 164, §21, 49 Stat. 319 ; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, §52(a); 50 Stat. 531 ; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, §514(a), 52 Stat. 76 ; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, §3, 60 Stat. 1064 ). Each of the 13 sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions either relating to false representations and statements, or overvaluation of security, with respect to one or more of the named banks, agencies, or corporations. These were consolidated and the false statement and security overvaluation provisions of all, form the basis of this section. The provisions of section 981 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to acceptance of loans or gratuities by examiners, were consolidated with similar provisions from other sections to form section 218 [now section 213] of this title. The provisions of said section 981 of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, prohibiting land bank and national farm loan association examiners from performing "any other service for compensation for any bank or banking or loan association, or for any person connected therewith in any capacity" were consolidated with similar provisions from other sections to form section 1909 of this title . Eight of the consolidated sections contained identical punishment, each providing for a maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 2 years. Two sections provided for a maximum fine of $10,000 and maximum imprisonment of 5 years. One section provided for maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 5 years, one section provided for maximum fine of $2,000 and maximum imprisonment of 2 years, and one section provided for maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 1 year. The punishment by maximum fine of $5,000 or maximum imprisonment of 2 years, or both, provided in this consolidated section was adopted as most consistent with the greater number of comparable sections. (See sections 1008 and 1010 of this title .) This is a reasonable reconciliation of the conflicting punishment provisions and adequate for the offenses described. The enumeration of "application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, repurchase agreement, commitment, or loan" and the wording "or any change or extension of any of the same, by renewal, deferment of action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, or substitution of security therefor" does not occur in any one of the original sections, but such enumeration and such wording are adequate, and they represent a composite of terms and transactions mentioned in each. In addition, changes were made in phraseology to secure uniformity of style, and some rephrasing was necessary, but the consolidation was without change of substance except as above indicated. Section 1138d(f) of Title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to conspiracy, was not added to this consolidated section for reasons given in reviser's note under section 493 of this title . 1949 Act [Section 21] conforms section 1014 of Title 18 U.S.C., to administrative practice which in turn was modified to comply with congressional policy.

Section 246 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., was divided. Part is in this section and the remainder is incorporated in section 752 of this title . Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 2002 — Pub. L. 107–273 substituted "fine under this title" for "fine of under this title". 1994 — Pub.

Section consolidates similar language of said sections of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Remaining provisions are in section 752 of this title .

Violations of this section may be prosecuted only in the Federal judicial district in which the original crime was alleged to have been committed, or in which the person was held in custody or confinement, or in which an avoidance of service of process or a contempt referred to in clause (3) of the first paragraph of this section is alleged to have been committed, and only upon formal approval in writing by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General of the United States, which function of approving prosecutions may not be delegated.

L. 104–294, title VI, §607(e), Oct. 11, 1996, 110 Stat. 3511 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §408e ( May 18, 1934, ch. 302, 48 Stat. 782 ; Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 735, 60 Stat. 789 ). Said section 408e was rewritten and the phrase "offenses as they are defined either at common law or by the laws of the place from which the fugitive flees" were inserted to remove the ambiguity discussed in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, in Brandenburg v. U.S ., decided September 6, 1944, not yet reported [144 F2d 656], reversing the conviction of the appellant. The court held that Congress intended the enumerated offenses to mean those as defined at common law. The effect of the rewritten section is to make the statute applicable whether the offense committed is one defined at common law or by the law of the state from which the fugitive flees. The words "offense punishable by imprisonment in a penitentiary" were substituted for "felony" to make the statute uniformly applicable and to include crimes of the grade of felony even where, as in New Jersey, they are denominated as misdemeanor, high misdemeanor or otherwise. Words "from any State, Territory, or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia" were omitted in view of definitive section 10 of this title . Words "upon conviction thereof" were deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured. Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1996 — Pub. L. 104–294 inserted at end of first par.

L. 100–690 inserted ", the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General," after "the Attorney General". 1970 — Pub. L. 91–452 inserted cl. (3) and ", or in which an avoidance of service of process or a contempt referred to in clause (3) of the first paragraph of this section is alleged to have been committed," after "in custody or confinement". 1961 — Pub. L. 87–368 substituted "a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime, punishable by death or which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the fugitive flees, or which, in the case of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor under the laws of said State" for "murder, kidnaping, burglary, robbery, mayhem, rape, assault with a dangerous weapon, arson punishable as a felony, or extortion accompanied by threats of violence, or attempt to commit any of the foregoing offenses as they are defined either at common law or by the laws of the place from which the fugitive flees", "death or which is a felony under the laws of such place, or which in the case of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor under the laws of said State," for "imprisonment in a penitentiary", and required that prosecutions must be upon the formal written approval of the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General, which function may not be delegated. 1956 —Act Apr. 6, 1956, inserted ", arson punishable as a felony" after "assault with a dangerous weapon".

Section consolidates the punishment provision of sections 454 and 567 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 452 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. The provision of said section 454 for the death penalty for first degree murder was consolidated with section 567 of said title 18, by adding the words "unless the jury qualifies its verdict by adding thereto 'without capital punishment' in which event he shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life". The punishment for second degree murder was changed and the phrase "for any term of years or for life" was substituted for the words "not less than ten years and may be imprisoned for life". This change conforms to a uniform policy of omitting the minimum punishment. Said section 567 was not included in section 2031 of this title since the rewritten punishment provision for rape removes the necessity for a qualified verdict. The special maritime and territorial jurisdiction provision was added in view of definitive section 7 of this title . Editorial Notes Amendments 2003 —Subsec. (a). Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §253 ( May 18, 1934, ch. 299, §1, 48 Stat. 780 ; Feb. 8, 1936, ch. 40, 49 Stat. 1105 ; June 26, 1936, ch. 830, title I, §3, 49 Stat. 1940 ; Reorg. Plan No. II, §4(f), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433 ; June 13, 1940, ch. 359, 54 Stat. 391 ). The section was extended to include United States judges, attorneys and their assistants, and officers of Federal, penal and correctional institutions in view of the obvious desirability of such protective legislation. Employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry have been included in this section to complete the revision of section 118 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was consolidated with the assault provisions of section 254 of said title 18 and is now section 111 of this title . There seemed no sound reason for including such officers in the protection against assaults but excluding them from the homicide sections. For like reasons the section was broadened to include officers or employees of the Secret Service or of the Bureau of Narcotics. Changes in phraseology were made. 1949 Act This section [section 24] amends section 1114 of title 18 , U.S.C., to conform more closely with the original statute from which it was derived.

( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 757 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §461 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §282, 35 Stat. 1144 ). Section restores the intent of the original enactments, R.S. §5344 , and act Mar. 3, 1905, ch. 1454, §5, 33 Stat. 1025 , and makes this section one of general application. In the Criminal Code of 1909, by placing it in chapter 11 , limited to places within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, such original intent was inadvertently lost as indicated by the entire absence of report or comment on such limitation. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000" in two places. §1116.

Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on sections 548 and 549 of title 18 , and sections 212, 213, 215, 217, 218 of title 25 , Indians, U.S. Code, 1940 ed. (R.S. §§2142, 2143, 2144, 2145, 2146; Feb. 18, 1875, ch. 80, §1, 18 Stat. 318 ; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§328, 329, 35 Stat. 1151 ; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167 ; June 28, 1932, ch. 284, 47 Stat. 337 ). This section consolidates numerous conflicting and inconsistent provisions of law into a concise statement of the applicable law. R.S. §§2145, 2146 (U.S.C., title 25, §§217, 218) extended to the Indian country with notable exceptions the criminal laws of the United States applicable to places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Crimes of Indians against Indians, and crimes punishable by tribal law were excluded. The confusion was not lessened by the cases of U.S. v. McBratney , 104 U.S. 622 and Draper v. U.S ., 17 S.Ct. 107, holding that crimes in Indian country by persons not Indians are not cognizable by Federal courts in absence of reservation or cession of exclusive jurisdiction applicable to places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Because of numerous statutes applicable only to Indians and prescribing punishment for crimes committed by Indians against Indians, "Indian country" was defined but once. (See act June 30, 1834, ch. 161, §1, 4, Stat. 729, which was later repealed.) Definition is based on latest construction of the term by the United States Supreme Court in U.S. v. McGowan , 58 S.Ct. 286, 302 U.S. 535, following U.S. v. Sandoval , 34 S.Ct. 1, 5, 231 U.S. 28, 46. (See also Donnelly v. U.S ., 33 S.Ct. 449, 228 U.S. 243; and Kills Plenty v. U.S ., 133 F.2d 292, certiorari denied, 1943, 63 S.Ct. 1172). (See reviser's note under section 1153 of this title .) Indian allotments were included in the definition on authority of the case of U.S. v. Pelican , 1913, 34 S.Ct. 396, 232 U.S. 442, 58 L.Ed. 676. 1949 Act This section [section 25], by adding to section 1151 of title 18 , U.S.C., the phrase "except as otherwise provided in sections 1154 and 1156 of this title ", incorporates in this section the limitations of the term "Indian country" which are added to sections 1154 and 1156 by sections 27 and 28 of this bill. Editorial Notes Amendments 1949 —Act May 24, 1949, incorporated the limitations of term "Indian country" which are contained in sections 1154 and 1156 of this title . Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Short Title of 1976 Amendment Pub. L. 94–297, §1, May 29, 1976, 90 Stat. 585 , provided: "That this Act [amending sections 113, 1153, and 3242 of this title ] may be cited as the 'Indian Crimes Act of 1976'." §1152. Laws governing Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country. This section shall not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 757 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 215, 217, 218 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (R.S. 2144, 2145, 2146; Feb. 18, 1875, ch. 80, §§1, 18 Stat. 318 ). Section consolidates said sections 217 and 218 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, and omits section 215 of said title as covered by the consolidation. See reviser's note under section 1153 of this title as to effect of consolidation of sections 548 and 549 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. Minor changes were made in translations and phraseology. §1153. Offenses committed within Indian country (a) Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of the following offenses, namely, murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, maiming, a felony under chapter 109A , incest, a felony assault under section 113, an assault against an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years, felony child abuse or neglect, arson, burglary, robbery, and a felony under section 661 of this title within the Indian country, shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. (b) Any offense referred to in subsection (a) of this section that is not defined and punished by Federal law in force within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States shall be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which such offense was committed as are in force at the time of such offense.

L. 113–4, title IX, §906(b), Mar. 7, 2013, 127 Stat. 125 .) Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§548, 549 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§328, 329, 35 Stat. 1151 ; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167 ; June 28, 1932, ch. 284, 47 Stat. 337 ). Section consolidates said sections 548 and 549 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. Section 548 of said title covered 10 crimes. Section 549 of said title covered the same except robbery and incest. The 1932 amendment of section 548 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., constituting the last paragraph of the section, is omitted and section 549 of said title to which it applied likewise is omitted. The revised section therefore suffices to cover prosecution of the specific offenses committed on all reservations as intended by Congress. Words "Indian country" were substituted for language relating to jurisdiction extending to reservations and rights-of-way, in view of definitive section 1151 of this title . Paul W. Hyatt, president, board of commissioners, Idaho State Bar, recommended that said section 548 be considered with other sections in title 25, Indians, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and revised to insure certainty as to questions of jurisdiction, and punishment on conviction. Insofar as the recommendation came within the scope of this revision, it was followed. The proviso in said section 548 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that rape should be defined in accordance with the laws of the State in which the offense was committed, was changed to include burglary so as to clarify the punishment for that offense. Venue provisions of said section 548 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 3242 of this title . Section 549 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., conferred special jurisdiction on the United States District Court for South Dakota of all crimes of murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, assault with a dangerous weapon, arson, burglary, and larceny committed within the limits of any Indian reservation within the State, whether by or against Indians or non-Indians. The Act of February 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 793 , from which said section 549 was derived, accepted the cession by South Dakota of such jurisdiction. The effect of revised sections 1151, 1152, and 1153 of this title is to deprive the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota of jurisdiction of offenses on Indian reservations committed by non-Indians against non-Indians and to restore such jurisdiction to the courts of the State of South Dakota as in other States. This reflects the views of the United States attorney, George Philip, of the district of South Dakota. Minor changes were made in translation and phraseology. 1949 Act This section [section 26] removes an ambiguity in section 1153 of title 18 , U.S.C., by eliminating the provision that the crime of rape in the Indian country is to be punished in accordance with the law of the State where the offense was committed, leaving the definition of the offense to be determined by State law, but providing that punishment of rape of an Indian by an Indian is to be by imprisonment at the discretion of the court. The offense of rape, other than rape of an Indian by an Indian within the Indian country, is covered by section 2031 of title 18 , U.S.C., and the offense of burglary by sections 1152 and 3242 of such title. Editorial Notes Amendments 2013 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 113–4 substituted "a felony assault under section 113" for "assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault resulting in serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 of this title )". 2006 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109–248 inserted "felony child abuse or neglect," after "years,". 1994 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "kidnapping" for "kidnaping" and inserted "(as defined in section 1365 of this title ), an assault against an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years" after "serious bodily injury". 1988 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 100–690 substituted "maiming, a felony under chapter 109A , incest" for " 'maiming' and all that follows through 'incest' ", thus clarifying execution of amendment by Pub. L. 99–646 and Pub. L. 99–654 but resulting in no change in text. See 1986 Amendment note below. 1986 — Pub. L. 99–646 and Pub. L. 99–654 which directed that section be amended identically by substituting in first par. "a felony under chapter 109A ," for "rape, involuntary sodomy, carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of sixteen years, assault with intent to commit rape," and by striking out in second and third pars. ", involuntary sodomy," was executed by making the substitution in subsec. (a) for "rape, involuntary sodomy, felonious sexual molestation of a minor, carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of sixteen years, assault with intent to commit rape," to reflect the probable intent of Congress in view of prior amendment of this section by Pub. L. 99–303, but amendment to second and third pars. could not be executed because such pars. were struck out by Pub. L. 99–303 . Pub. L. 99–303 inserted section catchline which had been eliminated by general amendment by section 1009 of Pub. L. 98–473, designated first par. as subsec. (a) and inserted "felonious sexual molestation of a minor,", struck out second par. which provided that, as used in this section, the offenses of burglary, involuntary sodomy, and incest be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which such offense was committed as are in force at the time of such offense, and struck out third par. and restated the provisions thereof in a new subsec. (b), substituting "Any offense referred to in subsection (a) of this section that is" for "In addition to the offenses of burglary, involuntary sodomy, and incest, any other of the above offenses which are". 1984 — Pub. L. 98–473 amended section generally, inserting offenses of maiming, involuntary sodomy and a felony committed under section 661 of this title and striking out reference to larceny in first par., and inserting ", involuntary sodomy," after "burglary" in third par. 1976 — Pub. L. 94–297 made changes in phraseology, added offense of kidnapping to the enumerated list of offenses subjecting any Indian to the same laws and penalties as all other persons, struck out applicability to assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury from paragraph covering the offenses of burglary and incest only, and substituted paragraph, relating to offenses in addition to offenses of burglary and incest, for paragraph relating to offenses of rape and assault with intent to commit rape. 1968 — Pub. L. 90–284 inserted offense of assault resulting in serious bodily injury. 1966 — Pub. L. 89–707 inserted offenses of carnal knowledge and assault with intent to commit rape, defined and proscribed the punishment for assault with intent to commit rape in accordance with the laws of the State in which the offense was committed, and required assault with a dangerous weapon and incest to be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which the offense was committed. 1949 —Act May 24, 1949, struck out provision that the crime of rape is to be punished in accordance with the law of the State where the offense was committed and in lieu inserted provision leaving punishment up to the discretion of the court. Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Effective Date of 1986 Amendments Amendments by Pub. L. 99–646 and Pub. L. 99–654 effective, respectively, 30 days after Nov. 10, 1986, and 30 days after Nov. 14, 1986, see section 87(e) of Pub. L. 99–646 and section 4 of Pub. L. 99–654, set out as an Effective Date note under section 2241 of this title . §1154. Intoxicants dispensed in Indian country (a) Whoever sells, gives away, disposes of, exchanges, or barters any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever, under any name, label, or brand, which produces intoxication, to any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been made while the title to the same shall be held in trust by the Government, or to any Indian who is a ward of the Government under charge of any Indian superintendent, or to any Indian, including mixed bloods, over whom the Government, through its departments, exercises guardianship, and whoever introduces or attempts to introduce any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever into the Indian country, shall, for the first offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and, for each subsequent offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. (b) It shall be a sufficient defense to any charge of introducing or attempting to introduce ardent spirits, ale, beer, wine, or intoxicating liquors into the Indian country that the acts charged were done under authority, in writing, from the Department of the Army or any officer duly authorized thereunto by the Department of the Army, but this subsection shall not bar the prosecution of any officer, soldier, sutler or storekeeper, attaché, or employee of the Army of the United States who barters, donates, or furnishes in any manner whatsoever liquors, beer, or any intoxicating beverage whatsoever to any Indian. (c) The term "Indian country" as used in this section does not include fee-patented lands in non-Indian communities or rights-of-way through Indian reservations, and this section does not apply to such lands or rights-of-way in the absence of a treaty or statute extending the Indian liquor laws thereto. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 758 ; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, §27, 63 Stat. 94 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(G), (I), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on sections 241, 242, 244a, 249, 254 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians ( R.S. §2139 ; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, §1, 19 Stat. 244 ; July 4, 1884, ch. 180, §1, 23 Stat. 94 ; July 23, 1892, ch. 234, 27 Stat. 260 ; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 146, §17, 39 Stat. 983 ; June 13, 1932, ch. 245, 47 Stat. 302 ; Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43, 48 Stat. 396 ; June 27, 1934, ch. 846, 48 Stat. 1245 ; June 15, 1938, ch. 435, §1, 52 Stat. 696 ). Section consolidates sections 241, 242, 244a, and 249 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. The portion of section 241 of said title which defined the substantive offense became subsection (a); the portion relating to the scope of the term "Indian country" was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "Indian country" in section 1151 of this title ; the portion of section 241 of said title excepting liquors introduced by the War Department became subsection (c), as limited by section 249 of said title; the portion respecting making complaint in county of offense, and with reference to arraignment, was omitted as covered by rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and the remainder of section 241 of said title was incorporated in section 1156 of this title . Section 254 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, was omitted as covered by this section and section 1156 of this title . That section was enacted in 1934 and excluded from the Indian liquor laws lands outside reservations where the land was no longer held by Indians under a trust patent or a deed or patent containing restrictions against alienation. Such enactment was prior to the June 15, 1938, amendment of section 241 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, in which the term "Indian country" was defined as including allotments where the title was held in trust by the Government or where it was inalienable without the consent of the United States. This provision, by implication, excluded cases where there was no trust or restriction on alienation and thereby achieved the same result as section 254 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. That amendment also repealed the act of Jan. 30, 1897, referred to in section 254 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. Insofar as the reference in section 254 of said title to "special Indian liquor laws" included section 244 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, the definition of Indian country in section 1151 of this title covers section 254 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. Words "or agent" were deleted as there have been no Indian agents since 1908. See section 64 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, and note thereunder. Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative and provision for commitment for nonpayment of fine was deleted. This change was also recommended by United States District Judge T. Blake Kennedy on the ground that, otherwise, section would be practically meaningless since, in most cases, offenders cannot pay a fine. The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to section 1262 of this title . Minor changes were made in phraseology. 1949 Act Subsection (a) of this section [section 27(a)] substitutes "Department of the Army" for "War Department", in subsection (b) of section 1154 of title 18 , U.S.C., to conform to such redesignation by act July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, title 11, §205(a), 61 Stat. 501 ( 5 U.S.C., 1946 ed., §181–1)). Subsection (b) of this section [section 27(b)] adds subsection (c) to such section 1154 in order to conform it and section 1156 more closely to the laws relating to intoxicating liquor in the Indian country as they have heretofore been construed. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $500" after "first offense, be" and for "fined not more than $2,000" after "subsequent offense, be". 1949 —Subsec. (b). Act May 24, 1949, §27(a), substituted "Department of the Army" for "War Department". Subsec. (c). Act May 24, 1949, §27(b), added subsec. (c). Executive Documents Transfer of Functions Functions of all other officers of Department of the Interior and functions of all agencies and employees of such Department, with two exceptions, transferred to Secretary of the Interior, with power vested in him to authorize their performance or performance of any of his functions by any of such officers, agencies, and employees, by Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1950, §§1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1262 , set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. §1155. Intoxicants dispensed on school site Whoever, on any tract of land in the former Indian country upon which is located any Indian school maintained by or under the supervision of the United States, manufactures, sells, gives away, or in any manner, or by any means furnishes to anyone, either for himself or another, any vinous, malt, or fermented liquors, or any other intoxicating drinks of any kind whatsoever, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes, whether medicated or not, or who carries, or in any manner has carried, into such area any such liquors or drinks, or who shall be interested in such manufacture, sale, giving away, furnishing to anyone, or carrying into such area any of such liquors or drinks, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 758 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 241a, 244a, of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians ( Mar. 1, 1895, ch. 145, §8, 28 Stat. 697 ; Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43, 48 Stat. 396 .) Section consolidates sections 241a and 244a of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. The effect of section 244a of said title in repealing section 241a of said title, except as to lands upon which Indian schools are maintained, was to continue prohibiting the dispensing of liquor in such areas. The words "upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured. The minimum punishment provision was omitted to conform to the policy adopted in revision of the 1909 Criminal Code. Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative. The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to section 1262 of this title . Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $500". §1156. Intoxicants possessed unlawfully Whoever, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes, possesses intoxicating liquors in the Indian country or where the introduction is prohibited by treaty or an Act of Congress, shall, for the first offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and, for each subsequent offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. The term "Indian country" as used in this section does not include fee-patented lands in non-Indian communities or rights-of-way through Indian reservations, and this section does not apply to such lands or rights-of-way in the absence of a treaty or statute extending the Indian liquor laws thereto. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 759 ; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, §28, 63 Stat. 94 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(G), (I), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes 1948 Act Based on sections 241, 244, 244a, 254 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (R.S. 2139; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, §1, 19 Stat. 244 ; July 23, 1892, ch. 234, 27 Stat. 260 ; May 25, 1918, ch. 86, §1, 40 Stat. 563 ; June 30, 1919, ch. 4, §1, 41 Stat. 4 ; Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43, 48 Stat. 396 ; June 27, 1934, ch. 846, 48 Stat. 1245 ; June 15, 1938, ch. 435, §1, 52 Stat. 696 ). The revision of section 244 of title 25 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, conforms with the effect thereon of sections 241, 244a, and 254 of said title. The provisions relating to scope of term "Indian country" were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "Indian country" in section 1151 of this title . Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative and provision for commitment for nonpayment of fine was deleted. Such change was also recommended by United States District Judge T. Blake Kennedy. (See reviser's note under section 1154 of this title .) The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to section 1262 of this title . Minor changes were made in phraseology. 1949 Act This section [section 28] adds to section 1156 of title 18 , U.S.C., a paragraph to conform this section and section 1154 of such title more closely to the laws relating to intoxicating liquors in the Indian country as they have been heretofore construed. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub.

The reference to the offense as a misdemeanor was omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title . The words "upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured. Maximum fine was changed from $2,000 to $500 to bring the offense within the category of petty offenses defined by section 1 of this title . (See reviser's note under section 1157 of this title .) Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $250,000" in third par. 1990 — Pub.

Section consolidates sections 408a and 408c of title 18 U.S.C., 1940 ed. Reference to persons aiding, abetting or causing was omitted as unnecessary because such persons are made principals by section 22 of this title . Words "upon conviction" were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured. Direction as to confinement "in the penitentiary" was omitted because of section 4082 of this title which commits all prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title .)

L. 103–322, §330021(1), which directed the amendment of this title "by striking 'kidnaping' each place it appears and inserting 'kidnapping' ", was executed by substituting "Kidnapping" for "Kidnaping" as section catchline, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

Subsection (b) of section 223 of title 27 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., has been reworded to apply the definition of intoxicating liquor contained in the laws of the respective States to this section only, in accordance with administrative interpretation. Said section 223 was derived from section 3 of the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936 (Act June 25, 1936, ch. 815, 49 Stat. 1928 ), which was enacted for the protection of dry States. As originally enacted, its provisions relating to such definition also embraced the interstate commerce liquor laws from which sections 1263–1265 of this title were derived. In the enforcement of the latter, however, their own definitions have been applied and not the definitions of the States into which or through which the liquor was shipped. Words "Territory, District, or Possession" were inserted after "State", to conform with the definition of "State" given in said section 222 of title 27 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such section, including subsection (b) thereof, is also incorporated in section 3615 of this title . Words "be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall" were omitted in view of definitive section 1 of this title . Minor changes were made throughout in arrangement and phraseology. 1949 Act This section [section 32] corrects a typographical error in section 1262 of title 18 , U.S.C. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000" in second par. 1990 — Pub. L. 101–647 substituted "State" for "state" in section catchline. 1949 —Act May 24, 1949, substituted "Districts" for "District" in last par. §1263. Marks and labels on packages Whoever knowingly ships into any place within the United States any package containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor, or any compound containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor fit for use for beverage purposes, unless such shipment is accompanied by copy of a bill of lading, or other document showing the name of the consignee, the nature of its contents, and the quantity contained therein, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 761 ; Pub. L. 90–518, §1, Sept. 26, 1968, 82 Stat. 872 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §390 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §240, 35 Stat. 1137 ; June 25, 1936, ch. 815, §8, 49 Stat. 1930 .) Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . References to Territory, District, etc., were revised and same changes made as in section 1264 of this title . The provision that "such liquor shall be forfeited to the United States" was omitted as covered by section 3615 of this title , which was derived from section 224 of title 27 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Intoxicating Liquors. The provision that such liquor "may be seized and condemned by like proceedings as those provided by law for the seizure and forfeiture of property imported into the United States contrary to law" was likewise omitted as covered by section 3615 of this title , which provides for seizure and forfeiture under the internal revenue laws rather than under provisions of law "for the seizure and forfeiture of property imported into the United States contrary to law" or, in other words, rather than under the customs laws. Section 224 of title 27 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Intoxicating Liquors, on which said section 3615 of this title is based, was derived from the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936 (Act June 25, 1936, ch. 815, 49 Stat. 1928 ). Said section 224 included, in its coverage, section 390 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., on which this revised section is based, even though the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936, in another section thereof, in amending said section 390, retained the provision that seizures and forfeitures thereunder should be under the customs laws. By eliminating this conflicting provision, a uniform procedure for seizures and forfeitures, under the internal revenue laws, is established under said section 3615 of this title . Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000". 1968 — Pub. L. 90–518 struck out "of or package" after "any package" and substituted "shipment is accompanied by copy of a bill of lading, or other document showing" for "package is so labeled on the outside cover as to plainly show".

Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . Words "Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof," which appeared twice, were omitted. See section 5 of this title defining the "United States." Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000". §1265. C.O.D. shipments prohibited Any railroad or express company, or other common carrier which, or any person who, in connection with the transportation of any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor, or any compound containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor fit for use for beverage purposes, into any State, Territory, District or Possession of the United States, which prohibits the delivery or sale therein of such liquor, collects the purchase price or any part thereof, before, on, or after delivery, from the consignee, or from any other person, or in any manner acts as the agent of the buyer or seller of any such liquor, for the purpose of buying or selling or completing the sale thereof, saving only in the actual transportation and delivery of the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §387 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §237, 35 Stat. 1136 ). Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . Words "in interstate or foreign commerce" were substituted for involved enumeration of places, thus permitting section to be condensed and simplified without change of meaning. See definitive section 10 of this title . The rewritten punishment provision is in lieu of the following: "for the first offense, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both; and for any subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not more than two years". There seems no point in fixing a punishment for a second offense less than that for the first offense. Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000" and inserted "or, being engaged in the business of procuring for a person in 1 State such a ticket, chance, share, or interest in a lottery, gift, enterprise or similar scheme conducted by another State (unless that business is permitted under an agreement between the States in question or appropriate authorities of those States), knowingly transmits in interstate or foreign commerce information to be used for the purpose of procuring such a ticket, chance, share, or interest;" after "scheme;".

The obsolete argot of the underworld was deleted as suggested by Hon. Emerich B. Freed, United States district judge, in a paper read before the 1944 Judicial Conference for the sixth circuit in which he said: A brief reference to §1341, which proposes to reenact the present section covering the use of the mails to defraud. This section is almost a page in length, is involved, and contains a great deal of superfluous language, including such terms as "sawdust swindle, green articles, green coin, green goods and green cigars." This section could be greatly simplified, and now-meaningless language eliminated. The other surplusage was likewise eliminated and the section simplified without change of meaning. A reference to causing to be placed any letter, etc. in any post office, or station thereof, etc. was omitted as unnecessary because of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . 1949 Act This section [section 34] corrects a typographical error in section 1341 of title 18 , U.S.C.

The embezzlement and theft provisions of section 82 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., are now incorporated in section 641 of this title . Words "or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder" were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "agency" in section 6 of this title . Designation of the place of confinement as "in a jail" was omitted because section 4082 of this title commits all prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative, who shall designate the place of confinement. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title .) The smaller penalty for offenses involving $50 or less was extended to offenses involving $100 or less. The use of $50 as the dividing line between felonies and misdemeanors originated at a time when that sum was of much greater value than $100 is now. The word "damage" was substituted twice for the word "value", and the definition of "value" was omitted as inapplicable to this section. These words and definition, however, are retained in that part of said section 82 which is now section 641 of this title . Minor changes were made in phraseology.

The phrase "and/or" appearing twice in section 581a of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., was deleted to avoid uncertainty and ambiguity.

L. 91–662, §§3, 5(b), 6(3), Jan. 8, 1971, 84 Stat. 1973 , 1974 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(K), (L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §334 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §211, 35 Stat. 1429 [1129]; Mar. 4, 1911, ch. 241, §2, 36 Stat. 1339 ). The attention of Congress is invited to the following decisions of the Federal courts construing this section and section 1462 of this title . In Youngs Rubber Corporation, Inc. v. C. I. Lee & Co., Inc ., C.C.A. 1930, 45 F. 2d 103, it was said that the word "adapted" as used in this section and in section 1462 of this title , the latter relating to importation and transportation of obscene matter, is not to be construed literally, the more reasonable interpretation being to construe the whole phrase "designed, adapted or intended" as requiring "an intent on the part of the sender that the article mailed or shipped by common carrier be used for illegal contraception or abortion or for indecent or immoral purposes." The court pointed out that, taken literally, the language of these sections would seem to forbid the transportation by mail or common carrier of anything "adapted," in the sense of being suitable or fitted, for preventing conception or for any indecent or immoral purpose, "even though the article might also be capable of legitimate uses and the sender in good faith supposed that it would be used only legitimately. Such a construction would prevent mailing to or by a physician of any drug or mechanical device 'adapted' for contraceptive or abortifacient uses, although the physician desired to use or to prescribe it for proper medical purposes. The intention to prevent a proper medical use of drugs or other articles merely because they are capable of illegal uses is not lightly to be ascribed to Congress. Section 334 [this section] forbids also the mailing of obscene books and writings; yet it has never been thought to bar from the mails medical writings sent to or by physicians for proper purposes, though of a character which would render them highly indecent if sent broadcast to all classes of persons." In United States v. Nicholas , C.C.A. 1938, 97 F. 2d 510, ruling directly on this point, it was held that the importation or sending through the mails of contraceptive articles or publications is not forbidden absolutely, but only when such articles or publications are unlawfully employed. The same rule was followed in Davis v. United States , C.C.A. 1933, 62 F. 2d 473, quoting the obiter opinion from Youngs Rubber Corporation v. C. I. Lee & Co., supra , and holding that the intent of the person mailing a circular conveying information for preventing conception that the article described therein should be used for condemned purposes was necessary for a conviction; also that this section must be given a reasonable construction. (See also United States v. One Package , C.C.A. 1936, 86 F. 2d 737.) Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . Minor changes in phraseology were made. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322, in eighth par., substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000" after "thereof, shall be" and for "fined not more than $10,000" after "offense, and shall be". 1971 — Pub. L. 91–662, §3(1), in second par., struck out "preventing conception or" before "producing abortion". Pub. L. 91–662, §3(1), in third par., struck out "preventing conception or" after "apply it for". Pub. L. 91–662, §3(2), (3), in fourth par., substituted "means abortion may be produced" for "means conception may be prevented or abortion produced". Pub. L. 91–662, §3(1), in fifth par., struck out "preventing conception or" after "applied for". Pub. L. 91–662, §6(3), in eighth par., inserted "or section 3001(e) of title 39 " after "this section". Section 5(b) of Pub. L. 91–662 inserted reference to section 4001(d) of Title 39 , The Postal Service, which reflected provisions of Title 39 prior to the effective date of Title 39, Postal Service, as enacted by the Postal Reorganization Act. Said section 4001(d) was repealed by section 6(2) of Pub. L. 91–662, effective on the date that the Board of Governors of the Postal Service establish as the effective date for section 3001 of Title 39 , Postal Service. 1958 — Pub. L. 85–796 provided in eighth par. for continuing offenses by use of the mails instead of by deposits for mailing and for punishment for subsequent offenses. 1955 —Act June 28, 1955, §1, in first par., substituted "indecent, filthy or vile article, matter, thing, device or substance" for "or filthy book, pamphlet, picture paper, letter, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character".

L. 97–291, §9, Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1258 , provided that: "(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), this Act and the amendments made by this Act [enacting this section and sections 1513 to 1515, 3579, and 3580 of this title , amending sections 1503, 1505, 1510, and 3146 of this title and Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 1501 and 3579 of this title ] shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 12, 1982]. "(b)(1) The amendment made by section 2 of this Act [enacting provisions set out as a note under this section] shall apply to presentence reports ordered to be made on or after March 1, 1983. "(2) The amendments made by section 5 of this Act [enacting sections 3579 and 3580 of this title ] shall apply with respect to offenses occurring on or after January 1, 1983." Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes Pub. L. 97–291, §2, Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1248 , provided that: "(a) The Congress finds and declares that: "(1) Without the cooperation of victims and witnesses, the criminal justice system would cease to function; yet with few exceptions these individuals are either ignored by the criminal justice system or simply used as tools to identify and punish offenders. "(2) All too often the victim of a serious crime is forced to suffer physical, psychological, or financial hardship first as a result of the criminal act and then as a result of contact with a criminal justice system unresponsive to the real needs of such victim. "(3) Although the majority of serious crimes falls under the jurisdiction of State and local law enforcement agencies, the Federal Government, and in particular the Attorney General, has an important leadership role to assume in ensuring that victims of crime, whether at the Federal, State, or local level, are given proper treatment by agencies administering the criminal justice system. "(4) Under current law, law enforcement agencies must have cooperation from a victim of crime and yet neither the agencies nor the legal system can offer adequate protection or assistance when the victim, as a result of such cooperation, is threatened or intimidated. "(5) While the defendant is provided with counsel who can explain both the criminal justice process and the rights of the defendant, the victim or witness has no counterpart and is usually not even notified when the defendant is released on bail, the case is dismissed, a plea to a lesser charge is accepted, or a court date is changed. "(6) The victim and witness who cooperate with the prosecutor often find that the transportation, parking facilities, and child care services at the court are unsatisfactory and they must often share the pretrial waiting room with the defendant or his family and friends. "(7) The victim may lose valuable property to a criminal only to lose it again for long periods of time to Federal law enforcement officials, until the trial and sometimes and [sic] appeals are over; many times that property is damaged or lost, which is particularly stressful for the elderly or poor. "(b) The Congress declares that the purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 1982 Amendment note set out under section 1501 of this title ] are— "(1) to enhance and protect the necessary role of crime victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process; "(2) to ensure that the Federal Government does all that is possible within limits of available resources to assist victims and witnesses of crime without infringing on the constitutional rights of the defendant; and "(3) to provide a model for legislation for State and local governments." Federal Guidelines for Treatment of Crime Victims and Witnesses in the Criminal Justice System Pub. L. 97–291, §6, Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1256 , as amended by Pub. L. 98–473, title II, §1408(b), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2177 , provided that: "(a) Within two hundred and seventy days after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 12, 1982], the Attorney General shall develop and implement guidelines for the Department of Justice consistent with the purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 1982 Amendment note set out under section 1501 of this title ]. In preparing the guidelines the Attorney General shall consider the following objectives: "(1) Services to victims of crime .—Law enforcement personnel should ensure that victims routinely receive emergency social and medical services as soon as possible and are given information on the following— "(A) availability of crime victim compensation (where applicable); "(B) community-based victim treatment programs; "(C) the role of the victim in the criminal justice process, including what they can expect from the system as well as what the system expects from them; and "(D) stages in the criminal justice process of significance to a crime victim, and the manner in which information about such stages can be obtained. "(2) Notification of availability of protection .—A victim or witness should routinely receive information on steps that law enforcement officers and attorneys for the Government can take to protect victims and witnesses from intimidation. "(3) Scheduling changes .—All victims and witnesses who have been scheduled to attend criminal justice proceedings should either be notified as soon as possible of any scheduling changes which will affect their appearances or have available a system for alerting witnesses promptly by telephone or otherwise. "(4) Prompt notification to victims of serious crimes .—Victims, witnesses, relatives of those victims and witnesses who are minors, and relatives of homicide victims should, if such persons provide the appropriate official with a current address and telephone number, receive prompt advance notification, if possible, of— "(A) the arrest of an accused; "(B) the initial appearance of an accused before a judicial officer; "(C) the release of the accused pending judicial proceedings; and "(D) proceedings in the prosecution and punishment of the accused (including entry of a plea of guilty, trial, sentencing, and, where a term of imprisonment is imposed, a hearing to determine a parole release date and the release of the accused from such imprisonment). "(5) Consultation with victim .—The victim of a serious crime, or in the case of a minor child or a homicide, the family of the victim, should be consulted by the attorney for the Government in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the disposition of any Federal criminal case brought as a result of such crime, including the views of the victim or family about— "(A) dismissal; "(B) release of the accused pending judicial proceedings; "(C) plea negotiations; and "(D) pretrial diversion program. "(6) Separate waiting area .—Victims and other prosecution witnesses should be provided prior to court appearance a waiting area that is separate from all other witnesses. "(7) Property return .—Law enforcement agencies and prosecutor should promptly return victim's property held for evidentiary purposes unless there is a compelling law enforcement reason for retaining it. "(8) Notification to employer .—A victim or witness who so requests should be assisted by law enforcement agencies and attorneys for the Government in informing employers that the need for victim and witness cooperation in the prosecution of the case may necessitate absence of that victim or witness from work. A victim or witness who, as a direct result of a crime or of cooperation with law enforcement agencies or attorneys for the Government, is subjected to serious financial strain, should be assisted by such agencies and attorneys in explaining to creditors the reason for such serious financial strain. "(9) Training by federal law enforcement training facilities .—Victim assistance education and training should be offered to persons taking courses at Federal law enforcement training facilities and attorneys for the Government so that victims may be promptly, properly, and completely assisted. "(10) General victim assistance .—The guidelines should also ensure that any other important assistance to victims and witnesses, such as the adoption of transportation, parking, and translator services for victims in court be provided. "(b) Nothing in this title shall be construed as creating a cause of action against the United States. "(c) The Attorney General shall assure that all Federal law enforcement agencies outside of the Department of Justice adopt guidelines consistent with subsection (a) of this section."

(c) If the retaliation occurred because of attendance at or testimony in a criminal case, the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for the offense under this section shall be the higher of that otherwise provided by law or the maximum term that could have been imposed for any offense charged in such case. (d) There is extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section. (e) Whoever knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both. (f) Whoever conspires to commit any offense under this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy. (g) A prosecution under this section may be brought in the district in which the official proceeding (whether pending, about to be instituted, or completed) was intended to be affected, or in which the conduct constituting the alleged offense occurred.

Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Effective Date Section effective Oct. 12, 1982, see section 9(a) of Pub. L. 97–291, set out as a note under section 1512 of this title . §1514. Civil action to restrain harassment of a victim or witness (a)(1) A United States district court, upon application of the attorney for the Government, shall issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting harassment of a victim or witness in a Federal criminal case if the court finds, from specific facts shown by affidavit or by verified complaint, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that harassment of an identified victim or witness in a Federal criminal case exists or that such order is necessary to prevent and restrain an offense under section 1512 of this title , other than an offense consisting of misleading conduct, or under section 1513 of this title . (2)(A) A temporary restraining order may be issued under this section without written or oral notice to the adverse party or such party's attorney in a civil action under this section if the court finds, upon written certification of facts by the attorney for the Government, that such notice should not be required and that there is a reasonable probability that the Government will prevail on the merits. (B) A temporary restraining order issued without notice under this section shall be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance and be filed forthwith in the office of the clerk of the court issuing the order. (C) A temporary restraining order issued under this section shall expire at such time, not to exceed 14 days from issuance, as the court directs; the court, for good cause shown before expiration of such order, may extend the expiration date of the order for up to 14 days or for such longer period agreed to by the adverse party. (D) When a temporary restraining order is issued without notice, the motion for a protective order shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence over all matters except older matters of the same character, and when such motion comes on for hearing, if the attorney for the Government does not proceed with the application for a protective order, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. (E) If on two days notice to the attorney for the Government, excluding intermediate weekends and holidays, or on such shorter notice as the court may prescribe, the adverse party appears and moves to dissolve or modify the temporary restraining order, the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require. (F) A temporary restraining order shall set forth the reasons for the issuance of such order, be specific in terms, and describe in reasonable detail (and not by reference to the complaint or other document) the act or acts being restrained. (b)(1) A United States district court, upon motion of the attorney for the Government, or its own motion, shall issue a protective order prohibiting harassment of a victim or witness in a Federal criminal case or investigation if the court, after a hearing, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that harassment of an identified victim or witness in a Federal criminal case or investigation exists or that such order is necessary to prevent and restrain an offense under section 1512 of this title , other than an offense consisting of misleading conduct, or under section 1513 of this title . (2) In the case of a minor witness or victim, the court shall issue a protective order prohibiting harassment or intimidation of the minor victim or witness if the court finds evidence that the conduct at issue is reasonably likely to adversely affect the willingness of the minor witness or victim to testify or otherwise participate in the Federal criminal case or investigation. Any hearing regarding a protective order under this paragraph shall be conducted in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (3), except that the court may issue an ex parte emergency protective order in advance of a hearing if exigent circumstances are present. If such an ex parte order is applied for or issued, the court shall hold a hearing not later than 14 days after the date such order was applied for or is issued. (3) At the hearing referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, any adverse party named in the complaint shall have the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. (4) A protective order shall set forth the reasons for the issuance of such order, be specific in terms, describe in reasonable detail the act or acts being restrained. (5) The court shall set the duration of effect of the protective order for such period as the court determines necessary to prevent harassment of the victim or witness but in no case for a period in excess of three years from the date of such order's issuance. The attorney for the Government may, at any time within ninety days before the expiration of such order, apply for a new protective order under this section, except that in the case of a minor victim or witness, the court may order that such protective order expires on the later of 3 years after the date of issuance or the date of the eighteenth birthday of that minor victim or witness. (c) Whoever knowingly and intentionally violates or attempts to violate an order issued under this section shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both. (d)(1) As used in this section— (A) the term "course of conduct" means a series of acts over a period of time, however short, indicating a continuity of purpose; (B) the term "harassment" means a serious act or course of conduct directed at a specific person that— (i) causes substantial emotional distress in such person; and (ii) serves no legitimate purpose; (C) the term "immediate family member" has the meaning given that term in section 115 and includes grandchildren; (D) the term "intimidation" means a serious act or course of conduct directed at a specific person that— (i) causes fear or apprehension in such person; and (ii) serves no legitimate purpose; (E) the term "restricted personal information" has the meaning give 1 that term in section 119; (F) the term "serious act" means a single act of threatening, retaliatory, harassing, or violent conduct that is reasonably likely to influence the willingness of a victim or witness to testify or participate in a Federal criminal case or investigation; and (G) the term "specific person" means a victim or witness in a Federal criminal case or investigation, and includes an immediate family member of such a victim or witness. (2) For purposes of subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (D)(ii) of paragraph (1), a court shall presume, subject to rebuttal by the person, that the distribution or publication using the Internet of a photograph of, or restricted personal information regarding, a specific person serves no legitimate purpose, unless that use is authorized by that specific person, is for news reporting purposes, is designed to locate that specific person (who has been reported to law enforcement as a missing person), or is part of a government-authorized effort to locate a fugitive or person of interest in a criminal, antiterrorism, or national security investigation.

Partial-birth abortions prohibited (a) Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both. This subsection does not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. This subsection takes effect 1 day after the enactment. (b) As used in this section— (1) the term "partial-birth abortion" means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion— (A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; and (B) performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus; and (2) the term "physician" means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice medicine and surgery by the State in which the doctor performs such activity, or any other individual legally authorized by the State to perform abortions: Provided, however, That any individual who is not a physician or not otherwise legally authorized by the State to perform abortions, but who nevertheless directly performs a partial-birth abortion, shall be subject to the provisions of this section. (c)(1) The father, if married to the mother at the time she receives a partial-birth abortion procedure, and if the mother has not attained the age of 18 years at the time of the abortion, the maternal grandparents of the fetus, may in a civil action obtain appropriate relief, unless the pregnancy resulted from the plaintiff's criminal conduct or the plaintiff consented to the abortion. (2) Such relief shall include— (A) money damages for all injuries, psychological and physical, occasioned by the violation of this section; and (B) statutory damages equal to three times the cost of the partial-birth abortion. (d)(1) A defendant accused of an offense under this section may seek a hearing before the State Medical Board on whether the physician's conduct was necessary to save the life of the mother whose life was endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. (2) The findings on that issue are admissible on that issue at the trial of the defendant. Upon a motion of the defendant, the court shall delay the beginning of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit such a hearing to take place. (e) A woman upon whom a partial-birth abortion is performed may not be prosecuted under this section, for a conspiracy to violate this section, or for an offense under section 2, 3, or 4 of this title based on a violation of this section. (Added Pub. L. 108–105, §3(a), Nov. 5, 2003, 117 Stat. 1206 .) Editorial Notes References in Text The enactment, referred to in subsec. (a), probably means the date of the enactment of Pub. L. 108–105, which enacted this section and was approved Nov. 5, 2003. Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries Short Title Pub. L. 108–105, §1, Nov. 5, 2003, 117 Stat. 1201 , provided that: "This Act [enacting this chapter and provisions set out as a note under this section] may be cited as the 'Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003'." Findings Pub. L. 108–105, §2, Nov. 5, 2003, 117 Stat. 1201 , provided that: "The Congress finds and declares the following: "(1) A moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion—an abortion in which a physician deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living, unborn child's body until either the entire baby's head is outside the body of the mother, or any part of the baby's trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother and only the head remains inside the womb, for the purpose of performing an overt act (usually the puncturing of the back of the child's skull and removing the baby's brains) that the person knows will kill the partially delivered infant, performs this act, and then completes delivery of the dead infant—is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited. "(2) Rather than being an abortion procedure that is embraced by the medical community, particularly among physicians who routinely perform other abortion procedures, partial-birth abortion remains a disfavored procedure that is not only unnecessary to preserve the health of the mother, but in fact poses serious risks to the long-term health of women and in some circumstances, their lives. As a result, at least 27 States banned the procedure as did the United States Congress which voted to ban the procedure during the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses. "(3) In Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 932 (2000), the United States Supreme Court opined 'that significant medical authority supports the proposition that in some circumstances, [partial birth abortion] would be the safest procedure' for pregnant women who wish to undergo an abortion. Thus, the Court struck down the State of Nebraska's ban on partial-birth abortion procedures, concluding that it placed an 'undue burden' on women seeking abortions because it failed to include an exception for partial-birth abortions deemed necessary to preserve the 'health' of the mother. "(4) In reaching this conclusion, the Court deferred to the Federal district court's factual findings that the partial-birth abortion procedure was statistically and medically as safe as, and in many circumstances safer than, alternative abortion procedures. "(5) However, substantial evidence presented at the Stenberg trial and overwhelming evidence presented and compiled at extensive congressional hearings, much of which was compiled after the district court hearing in Stenberg, and thus not included in the Stenberg trial record, demonstrates that a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman, poses significant health risks to a woman upon whom the procedure is performed and is outside the standard of medical care. "(6) Despite the dearth of evidence in the Stenberg trial court record supporting the district court's findings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court refused to set aside the district court's factual findings because, under the applicable standard of appellate review, they were not 'clearly erroneous'. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous 'when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985). Under this standard, 'if the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently'. Id. at 574. "(7) Thus, in Stenberg, the United States Supreme Court was required to accept the very questionable findings issued by the district court judge—the effect of which was to render null and void the reasoned factual findings and policy determinations of the United States Congress and at least 27 State legislatures. "(8) However, under well-settled Supreme Court jurisprudence, the United States Congress is not bound to accept the same factual findings that the Supreme Court was bound to accept in Stenberg under the 'clearly erroneous' standard. Rather, the United States Congress is entitled to reach its own factual findings—findings that the Supreme Court accords great deference—and to enact legislation based upon these findings so long as it seeks to pursue a legitimate interest that is within the scope of the Constitution, and draws reasonable inferences based upon substantial evidence. "(9) In Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), the Supreme Court articulated its highly deferential review of congressional factual findings when it addressed the constitutionality of section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 [ 52 U.S.C. 10303(e) ]. Regarding Congress' factual determination that section 4(e) would assist the Puerto Rican community in 'gaining nondiscriminatory treatment in public services,' the Court stated that '[i]t was for Congress, as the branch that made this judgment, to assess and weigh the various conflicting considerations * * *. It is not for us to review the congressional resolution of these factors. It is enough that we be able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might resolve the conflict as it did. There plainly was such a basis to support section 4(e) in the application in question in this case.'. Id. at 653. "(10) Katzenbach's highly deferential review of Congress' factual conclusions was relied upon by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia when it upheld the 'bail-out' provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ( 42 U.S.C. 1973c ) [now 52 U.S.C. 10304 ], stating that 'congressional fact finding, to which we are inclined to pay great deference, strengthens the inference that, in those jurisdictions covered by the Act, state actions discriminatory in effect are discriminatory in purpose'. City of Rome, Georgia v. U.S., 472 F. Supp. 221 (D.D.C. 1979) aff'd City of Rome, Georgia v. U.S., 446 U.S. 156 (1980). "(11) The Court continued its practice of deferring to congressional factual findings in reviewing the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 [ Pub. L. 102–385, see Tables for classification]. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, 512 U.S. 622 (1994) (Turner I) and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, 520 U.S. 180 (1997) (Turner II). At issue in the Turner cases was Congress' legislative finding that, absent mandatory carriage rules, the continued viability of local broadcast television would be 'seriously jeopardized'. The Turner I Court recognized that as an institution, 'Congress is far better equipped than the judiciary to "amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data" bearing upon an issue as complex and dynamic as that presented here', 512 U.S. at 665–66. Although the Court recognized that 'the deference afforded to legislative findings does "not foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearing on an issue of constitutional law," ' its 'obligation to exercise independent judgment when First Amendment rights are implicated is not a license to reweigh the evidence de novo, or to replace Congress' factual predictions with our own. Rather, it is to assure that, in formulating its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.'. Id. at 666. "(12) Three years later in Turner II, the Court upheld the 'must-carry' provisions based upon Congress' findings, stating the Court's 'sole obligation is "to assure that, in formulating its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence." ' 520 U.S. at 195. Citing its ruling in Turner I, the Court reiterated that '[w]e owe Congress' findings deference in part because the institution "is far better equipped than the judiciary to 'amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data' bearing upon" legislative questions,' id. at 195, and added that it 'owe[d] Congress' findings an additional measure of deference out of respect for its authority to exercise the legislative power.'. Id. at 196. "(13) There exists substantial record evidence upon which Congress has reached its conclusion that a ban on partial-birth abortion is not required to contain a 'health' exception, because the facts indicate that a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman, poses serious risks to a woman's health, and lies outside the standard of medical care. Congress was informed by extensive hearings held during the 104th, 105th, 107th, and 108th Congresses and passed a ban on partial-birth abortion in the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses. These findings reflect the very informed judgment of the Congress that a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman, poses serious risks to a woman's health, and lies outside the standard of medical care, and should, therefore, be banned. "(14) Pursuant to the testimony received during extensive legislative hearings during the 104th, 105th, 107th, and 108th Congresses, Congress finds and declares that: "(A) Partial-birth abortion poses serious risks to the health of a woman undergoing the procedure. Those risks include, among other things: An increase in a woman's risk of suffering from cervical incompetence, a result of cervical dilation making it difficult or impossible for a woman to successfully carry a subsequent pregnancy to term; an increased risk of uterine rupture, abruption, amniotic fluid embolus, and trauma to the uterus as a result of converting the child to a footling breech position, a procedure which, according to a leading obstetrics textbook, 'there are very few, if any, indications for * * * other than for delivery of a second twin'; and a risk of lacerations and secondary hemorrhaging due to the doctor blindly forcing a sharp instrument into the base of the unborn child's skull while he or she is lodged in the birth canal, an act which could result in severe bleeding, brings with it the threat of shock, and could ultimately result in maternal death. "(B) There is no credible medical evidence that partial-birth abortions are safe or are safer than other abortion procedures. No controlled studies of partial-birth abortions have been conducted nor have any comparative studies been conducted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy compared to other abortion methods. Furthermore, there have been no articles published in peer-reviewed journals that establish that partial-birth abortions are superior in any way to established abortion procedures. Indeed, unlike other more commonly used abortion procedures, there are currently no medical schools that provide instruction on abortions that include the instruction in partial-birth abortions in their curriculum. "(C) A prominent medical association has concluded that partial-birth abortion is 'not an accepted medical practice', that it has 'never been subject to even a minimal amount of the normal medical practice development,' that 'the relative advantages and disadvantages of the procedure in specific circumstances remain unknown,' and that 'there is no consensus among obstetricians about its use'. The association has further noted that partial-birth abortion is broadly disfavored by both medical experts and the public, is 'ethically wrong,' and 'is never the only appropriate procedure'. "(D) Neither the plaintiff in Stenberg v. Carhart, nor the experts who testified on his behalf, have identified a single circumstance during which a partial-birth abortion was necessary to preserve the health of a woman. "(E) The physician credited with developing the partial-birth abortion procedure has testified that he has never encountered a situation where a partial-birth abortion was medically necessary to achieve the desired outcome and, thus, is never medically necessary to preserve the health of a woman. "(F) A ban on the partial-birth abortion procedure will therefore advance the health interests of pregnant women seeking to terminate a pregnancy. "(G) In light of this overwhelming evidence, Congress and the States have a compelling interest in prohibiting partial-birth abortions. In addition to promoting maternal health, such a prohibition will draw a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide, that preserves the integrity of the medical profession, and promotes respect for human life. "(H) Based upon Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), a governmental interest in protecting the life of a child during the delivery process arises by virtue of the fact that during a partial-birth abortion, labor is induced and the birth process has begun. This distinction was recognized in Roe when the Court noted, without comment, that the Texas parturition statute, which prohibited one from killing a child 'in a state of being born and before actual birth,' was not under attack. This interest becomes compelling as the child emerges from the maternal body. A child that is completely born is a full, legal person entitled to constitutional protections afforded a 'person' under the United States Constitution. Partial-birth abortions involve the killing of a child that is in the process, in fact mere inches away from, becoming a 'person'. Thus, the government has a heightened interest in protecting the life of the partially-born child. "(I) This, too, has not gone unnoticed in the medical community, where a prominent medical association has recognized that partial-birth abortions are 'ethically different from other destructive abortion techniques because the fetus, normally twenty weeks or longer in gestation, is killed outside of the womb'. According to this medical association, the ' "partial birth" gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body'. "(J) Partial-birth abortion also confuses the medical, legal, and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and promote life, as the physician acts directly against the physical life of a child, whom he or she had just delivered, all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end that life. Partial-birth abortion thus appropriates the terminology and techniques used by obstetricians in the delivery of living children—obstetricians who preserve and protect the life of the mother and the child—and instead uses those techniques to end the life of the partially-born child. "(K) Thus, by aborting a child in the manner that purposefully seeks to kill the child after he or she has begun the process of birth, partial-birth abortion undermines the public's perception of the appropriate role of a physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process during which life is brought into the world, in order to destroy a partially-born child. "(L) The gruesome and inhumane nature of the partial-birth abortion procedure and its disturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn infant promotes a complete disregard for infant human life that can only be countered by a prohibition of the procedure. "(M) The vast majority of babies killed during partial-birth abortions are alive until the end of the procedure. It is a medical fact, however, that unborn infants at this stage can feel pain when subjected to painful stimuli and that their perception of this pain is even more intense than that of newborn infants and older children when subjected to the same stimuli. Thus, during a partial-birth abortion procedure, the child will fully experience the pain associated with piercing his or her skull and sucking out his or her brain. "(N) Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to protect such life. Thus, Congress has a compelling interest in acting—indeed it must act—to prohibit this inhumane procedure. "(O) For these reasons, Congress finds that partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to preserve the health of the mother; is in fact unrecognized as a valid abortion procedure by the mainstream medical community; poses additional health risks to the mother; blurs the line between abortion and infanticide in the killing of a partially-born child just inches from birth; and confuses the role of the physician in childbirth and should, therefore, be banned."

Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . Provisions as to holding of kidnapped persons were omitted as superseded by section 1201 of this title and original text relating to sale or holding to involuntary servitude retained. Words "within the United States" were substituted for "within the jurisdiction of the United States". (See section 5 of this title defining "United States".) The punishment provisions were derived from section 446 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., as more consistent with other sections of this chapter. The requirement of section 423 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of one-half the fine "for the use of the person prosecuting the indictment to effect" was omitted as meaningless. (See also reviser's note under section 1585 of this title .) Mandatory-punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative. Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 2008 — Pub. L. 110–457 designated existing provisions as subsec. (a) and added subsec. (b). 2000 — Pub. L. 106–386 substituted "20 years" for "10 years" and inserted at end "If death results from the violation of this section, or if the violation includes kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or the attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, the defendant shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or life, or both." 1996 — Pub.

Seizure, detention, transportation or sale of slaves Whoever, being a citizen or resident of the United States and a member of the crew or ship's company of any foreign vessel engaged in the slave trade, or whoever, being of the crew or ship's company of any vessel owned in whole or in part, or navigated for, or in behalf of, any citizen of the United States, lands from such vessel, and on any foreign shore seizes any person with intent to make that person a slave, or decoys, or forcibly brings, carries, receives, confines, detains or transports any person as a slave on board such vessel, or, on board such vessel, offers or attempts to sell any such person as a slave, or on the high seas or anywhere on tide water, transfers or delivers to any other vessel any such person with intent to make such person a slave, or lands or delivers on shore from such vessel any person with intent to sell, or having previously sold, such person as a slave, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than seven years, or both.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§421, 422, 425 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§246, 247, 250, 35 Stat. 1138 , 1139 ). Section consolidates and restores three basic sections (act May 25, 1820, ch. 113, §§4, 5, 3 Stat. 600 , 601 ; act Apr. 20, 1818, ch. 91, §4, 3 Stat. 451 ). As reenacted in the Revised Statutes, such sections were extended and broadened beyond such basic acts. The language at the beginning, "being a citizen or resident of the United States", was inserted from said section 425 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., as enacted originally. While the basic provisions of said sections 421 and 422 are thus broadened, their application as enacted in the 1909 Criminal Code is narrowed. Designation in said section 421 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., of offender as a "pirate" was omitted as unnecessary. The punishment provision of section 1582 of this title (incorporated by reference in said section 425) has been adopted as consistent with other slave-trade statutes rather than the life-imprisonment penalty contained in said sections 421 and 422 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. However, the requirement in section 1582 of this title that one-half the fine be for the "use of the person prosecuting the indictment to effect" was omitted as meaningless. Mandatory-punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000". §1586. Service on vessels in slave trade Whoever, being a citizen or resident of the United States, voluntarily serves on board of any vessel employed or made use of in the transportation of slaves from any foreign country or place to another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

L. 114–22 ] amends section 1591 of title 18, United States Code , to add the words 'solicits or patronizes' to the sex trafficking statute making absolutely clear for judges, juries, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials that criminals who purchase sexual acts from human trafficking victims may be arrested, prosecuted, and convicted as sex trafficking offenders when this is merited by the facts of a particular case." §1592. Unlawful conduct with respect to documents in furtherance of trafficking, peonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor (a) Whoever knowingly destroys, conceals, removes, confiscates, or possesses any actual or purported passport or other immigration document, or any other actual or purported government identification document, of another person— (1) in the course of a violation of section 1581, 1583, 1584, 1589, 1590, 1591, or 1594(a); (2) with intent to violate section 1581, 1583, 1584, 1589, 1590, or 1591; or (3) to prevent or restrict or to attempt to prevent or restrict, without lawful authority, the person's liberty to move or travel, in order to maintain the labor or services of that person, when the person is or has been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, as defined in section 103 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both. (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to the conduct of a person who is or has been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, as defined in section 103 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, if that conduct is caused by, or incident to, that trafficking.

Words "except as otherwise expressly provided by law" were inserted to avoid conflict with perjury provisions in other titles where the punishment and application vary. More than 25 additional provisions are in the code. For construction and application of several such sections, see Behrle v. United States (App. D.C. 1938, 100 F. 2d 714), United States v.

(b) This section is applicable whether the conduct occurred within or without the United States. (c) An indictment or information for violation of this section alleging that, in any proceedings before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States, the defendant under oath has knowingly made two or more declarations, which are inconsistent to the degree that one of them is necessarily false, need not specify which declaration is false if— (1) each declaration was material to the point in question, and (2) each declaration was made within the period of the statute of limitations for the offense charged under this section. In any prosecution under this section, the falsity of a declaration set forth in the indictment or information shall be established sufficient for conviction by proof that the defendant while under oath made irreconcilably contradictory declarations material to the point in question in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury. It shall be a defense to an indictment or information made pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection that the defendant at the time he made each declaration believed the declaration was true. (d) Where, in the same continuous court or grand jury proceeding in which a declaration is made, the person making the declaration admits such declaration to be false, such admission shall bar prosecution under this section if, at the time the admission is made, the declaration has not substantially affected the proceeding, or it has not become manifest that such falsity has been or will be exposed. (e) Proof beyond a reasonable doubt under this section is sufficient for conviction. It shall not be necessary that such proof be made by any particular number of witnesses or by documentary or other type of evidence. (Added Pub.

Attack to plunder vessel. 1660. Receipt of pirate property. 1661. Robbery ashore. Historical and Revision Notes In the light of far-reaching developments in the field of international law and foreign relations, the law of piracy is deemed to require a fundamental reconsideration and complete restatement, perhaps resulting in drastic changes by way of modification and expansion. Such a task may be regarded as beyond the scope of this project. The present revision is, therefore, confined to the making of some obvious and patent corrections. It is recommended, however, that at some opportune time in the near future, the subject of piracy be entirely reconsidered and the law bearing on it modified and restated in accordance with the needs of the times. §1651. Piracy under law of nations Whoever, on the high seas, commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations, and is afterwards brought into or found in the United States, shall be imprisoned for life.

Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative. The last sentence relating to venue was omitted as unnecessary in view of the general provision to the same effect in section 3238 of this title . Minor changes were made in phraseology and arrangement. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000" in last par. §1655.

Plunder of distressed vessel (a) Whoever plunders, steals, or destroys any money, goods, merchandise, or other effects from or belonging to any vessel in distress, or wrecked, lost, stranded, or cast away, upon the sea, or upon any reef, shoal, bank, or rocks of the sea, or in any other place within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.

This particular language was omitted because such powers and duties as it prescribes would devolve upon the Postmaster General without legislation and also because said section 172 of Title 39 , which was derived from the act of August 4, 1886, shown in the credits above, was impliedly repealed by the general repealing clause of section 341 of the Criminal Code of 1909. Section 208 of that Code contained the provisions which formed the basis for said section 329 of Title 18 .

Section consolidates sections 753j and 908 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. The section was broadened to include the taking or sending out of contraband from the institution. This was suggested by representatives of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. In other respects the section was rewritten without change of substance. The words "narcotic", "drug", "weapon" and "contraband" were omitted, since the insertion of the words "contrary to any rule or regulation promulgated by the attorney general" preserves the intent of the original statutes. Words "guilty of a felony" were deleted as unnecessary in view of definitive section 1 of this title . (See also reviser's note under section 550 of this title .) Minor verbal changes also were made.

(c) Jurisdiction .—The district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction of civil actions brought under this section. (d) Period of Limitations .—A civil action under subsection (b) may not be commenced later than 3 years after the date on which the misappropriation with respect to which the action would relate is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.

"It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note above] to seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States by strengthening the legal tools in the evidence-gathering process, by establishing new penal prohibitions, and by providing enhanced sanctions and new remedies to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged in organized crime."

L. 100–690 substituted "subsection" for "subsections". §1963. Criminal penalties (a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law— (1) any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962; (2) any— (A) interest in; (B) security of; (C) claim against; or (D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of influence over; any enterprise which the person has established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of section 1962; and (3) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds which the person obtained, directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962. The court, in imposing sentence on such person shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this section, that the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this section, a defendant who derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds. (b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes— (1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and found in land; and (2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights, privileges, interests, claims, and securities. (c) All right, title, and interest in property described in subsection (a) vests in the United States upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section. Any such property that is subsequently transferred to a person other than the defendant may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the United States, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing pursuant to subsection (l) that he is a bona fide purchaser for value of such property who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section. (d)(1) Upon application of the United States, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any other action to preserve the availability of property described in subsection (a) for forfeiture under this section— (A) upon the filing of an indictment or information charging a violation of section 1962 of this chapter and alleging that the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section; or (B) prior to the filing of such an indictment or information, if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that— (i) there is a substantial probability that the United States will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and (ii) the need to preserve the availability of the property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered: Provided, however , That an order entered pursuant to subparagraph (B) shall be effective for not more than ninety days, unless extended by the court for good cause shown or unless an indictment or information described in subparagraph (A) has been filed. (2) A temporary restraining order under this subsection may be entered upon application of the United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the property, if the United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture. Such a temporary order shall expire not more than fourteen days after the date on which it is entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period. A hearing requested concerning an order entered under this paragraph shall be held at the earliest possible time, and prior to the expiration of the temporary order. (3) The court may receive and consider, at a hearing held pursuant to this subsection, evidence and information that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. (e) Upon conviction of a person under this section, the court shall enter a judgment of forfeiture of the property to the United States and shall also authorize the Attorney General to seize all property ordered forfeited upon such terms and conditions as the court shall deem proper. Following the entry of an order declaring the property forfeited, the court may, upon application of the United States, enter such appropriate restraining orders or injunctions, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the United States in the property ordered forfeited. Any income accruing to, or derived from, an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise which has been ordered forfeited under this section may be used to offset ordinary and necessary expenses to the enterprise which are required by law, or which are necessary to protect the interests of the United States or third parties. (f) Following the seizure of property ordered forfeited under this section, the Attorney General shall direct the disposition of the property by sale or any other commercially feasible means, making due provision for the rights of any innocent persons. Any property right or interest not exercisable by, or transferable for value to, the United States shall expire and shall not revert to the defendant, nor shall the defendant or any person acting in concert with or on behalf of the defendant be eligible to purchase forfeited property at any sale held by the United States. Upon application of a person, other than the defendant or a person acting in concert with or on behalf of the defendant, the court may restrain or stay the sale or disposition of the property pending the conclusion of any appeal of the criminal case giving rise to the forfeiture, if the applicant demonstrates that proceeding with the sale or disposition of the property will result in irreparable injury, harm or loss to him. Notwithstanding 31 U.S.C. 3302(b), the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of property forfeited under this section and any moneys forfeited shall be used to pay all proper expenses for the forfeiture and the sale, including expenses of seizure, maintenance and custody of the property pending its disposition, advertising and court costs. The Attorney General shall deposit in the Treasury any amounts of such proceeds or moneys remaining after the payment of such expenses. (g) With respect to property ordered forfeited under this section, the Attorney General is authorized to— (1) grant petitions for mitigation or remission of forfeiture, restore forfeited property to victims of a violation of this chapter, or take any other action to protect the rights of innocent persons which is in the interest of justice and which is not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter; (2) compromise claims arising under this section; (3) award compensation to persons providing information resulting in a forfeiture under this section; (4) direct the disposition by the United States of all property ordered forfeited under this section by public sale or any other commercially feasible means, making due provision for the rights of innocent persons; and (5) take appropriate measures necessary to safeguard and maintain property ordered forfeited under this section pending its disposition. (h) The Attorney General may promulgate regulations with respect to— (1) making reasonable efforts to provide notice to persons who may have an interest in property ordered forfeited under this section; (2) granting petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture; (3) the restitution of property to victims of an offense petitioning for remission or mitigation of forfeiture under this chapter; (4) the disposition by the United States of forfeited property by public sale or other commercially feasible means; (5) the maintenance and safekeeping of any property forfeited under this section pending its disposition; and (6) the compromise of claims arising under this chapter. Pending the promulgation of such regulations, all provisions of law relating to the disposition of property, or the proceeds from the sale thereof, or the remission or mitigation of forfeitures for violation of the customs laws, and the compromise of claims and the award of compensation to informers in respect of such forfeitures shall apply to forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been incurred, under the provisions of this section, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions hereof. Such duties as are imposed upon the Customs Service or any person with respect to the disposition of property under the customs law shall be performed under this chapter by the Attorney General. (i) Except as provided in subsection (l), no party claiming an interest in property subject to forfeiture under this section may— (1) intervene in a trial or appeal of a criminal case involving the forfeiture of such property under this section; or (2) commence an action at law or equity against the United States concerning the validity of his alleged interest in the property subsequent to the filing of an indictment or information alleging that the property is subject to forfeiture under this section. (j) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to enter orders as provided in this section without regard to the location of any property which may be subject to forfeiture under this section or which has been ordered forfeited under this section. (k) In order to facilitate the identification or location of property declared forfeited and to facilitate the disposition of petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture, after the entry of an order declaring property forfeited to the United States the court may, upon application of the United States, order that the testimony of any witness relating to the property forfeited be taken by deposition and that any designated book, paper, document, record, recording, or other material not privileged be produced at the same time and place, in the same manner as provided for the taking of depositions under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (l)(1) Following the entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the United States shall publish notice of the order and of its intent to dispose of the property in such manner as the Attorney General may direct. The Government may also, to the extent practicable, provide direct written notice to any person known to have alleged an interest in the property that is the subject of the order of forfeiture as a substitute for published notice as to those persons so notified. (2) Any person, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in property which has been ordered forfeited to the United States pursuant to this section may, within thirty days of the final publication of notice or his receipt of notice under paragraph (1), whichever is earlier, petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his alleged interest in the property. The hearing shall be held before the court alone, without a jury. (3) The petition shall be signed by the petitioner under penalty of perjury and shall set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner's right, title, or interest in the property, the time and circumstances of the petitioner's acquisition of the right, title, or interest in the property, any additional facts supporting the petitioner's claim, and the relief sought. (4) The hearing on the petition shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with the interests of justice, be held within thirty days of the filing of the petition. The court may consolidate the hearing on the petition with a hearing on any other petition filed by a person other than the defendant under this subsection. (5) At the hearing, the petitioner may testify and present evidence and witnesses on his own behalf, and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing. The United States may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of its claim to the property and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing. In addition to testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the court shall consider the relevant portions of the record of the criminal case which resulted in the order of forfeiture. (6) If, after the hearing, the court determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that— (A) the petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property, and such right, title, or interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title, or interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title, or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section; or (B) the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title, or interest in the property and was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section; the court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination. (7) Following the court's disposition of all petitions filed under this subsection, or if no such petitions are filed following the expiration of the period provided in paragraph (2) for the filing of such petitions, the United States shall have clear title to property that is the subject of the order of forfeiture and may warrant good title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee. (m) If any of the property described in subsection (a), as a result of any act or omission of the defendant— (1) cannot be located upon the exercise of due diligence; (2) has been transferred or sold to, or deposited with, a third party; (3) has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court; (4) has been substantially diminished in value; or (5) has been commingled with other property which cannot be divided without difficulty; the court shall order the forfeiture of any other property of the defendant up to the value of any property described in paragraphs (1) through (5).

Civil investigative demand (a) Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person or enterprise may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary materials relevant to a racketeering investigation, he may, prior to the institution of a civil or criminal proceeding thereon, issue in writing, and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person to produce such material for examination. (b) Each such demand shall— (1) state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged racketeering violation which is under investigation and the provision of law applicable thereto; (2) describe the class or classes of documentary material produced thereunder with such definiteness and certainty as to permit such material to be fairly identified; (3) state that the demand is returnable forthwith or prescribe a return date which will provide a reasonable period of time within which the material so demanded may be assembled and made available for inspection and copying or reproduction; and (4) identify the custodian to whom such material shall be made available. (c) No such demand shall— (1) contain any requirement which would be held to be unreasonable if contained in a subpena duces tecum issued by a court of the United States in aid of a grand jury investigation of such alleged racketeering violation; or (2) require the production of any documentary evidence which would be privileged from disclosure if demanded by a subpena duces tecum issued by a court of the United States in aid of a grand jury investigation of such alleged racketeering violation. (d) Service of any such demand or any petition filed under this section may be made upon a person by— (1) delivering a duly executed copy thereof to any partner, executive officer, managing agent, or general agent thereof, or to any agent thereof authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process on behalf of such person, or upon any individual person; (2) delivering a duly executed copy thereof to the principal office or place of business of the person to be served; or (3) depositing such copy in the United States mail, by registered or certified mail duly addressed to such person at its principal office or place of business. (e) A verified return by the individual serving any such demand or petition setting forth the manner of such service shall be prima facie proof of such service. In the case of service by registered or certified mail, such return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt of delivery of such demand. (f)(1) The Attorney General shall designate a racketeering investigator to serve as racketeer document custodian, and such additional racketeering investigators as he shall determine from time to time to be necessary to serve as deputies to such officer. (2) Any person upon whom any demand issued under this section has been duly served shall make such material available for inspection and copying or reproduction to the custodian designated therein at the principal place of business of such person, or at such other place as such custodian and such person thereafter may agree and prescribe in writing or as the court may direct, pursuant to this section on the return date specified in such demand, or on such later date as such custodian may prescribe in writing. Such person may upon written agreement between such person and the custodian substitute for copies of all or any part of such material originals thereof. (3) The custodian to whom any documentary material is so delivered shall take physical possession thereof, and shall be responsible for the use made thereof and for the return thereof pursuant to this chapter. The custodian may cause the preparation of such copies of such documentary material as may be required for official use under regulations which shall be promulgated by the Attorney General. While in the possession of the custodian, no material so produced shall be available for examination, without the consent of the person who produced such material, by any individual other than the Attorney General. Under such reasonable terms and conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe, documentary material while in the possession of the custodian shall be available for examination by the person who produced such material or any duly authorized representatives of such person. (4) Whenever any attorney has been designated to appear on behalf of the United States before any court or grand jury in any case or proceeding involving any alleged violation of this chapter, the custodian may deliver to such attorney such documentary material in the possession of the custodian as such attorney determines to be required for use in the presentation of such case or proceeding on behalf of the United States. Upon the conclusion of any such case or proceeding, such attorney shall return to the custodian any documentary material so withdrawn which has not passed into the control of such court or grand jury through the introduction thereof into the record of such case or proceeding. (5) Upon the completion of— (i) the racketeering investigation for which any documentary material was produced under this chapter, and (ii) any case or proceeding arising from such investigation, the custodian shall return to the person who produced such material all such material other than copies thereof made by the Attorney General pursuant to this subsection which has not passed into the control of any court or grand jury through the introduction thereof into the record of such case or proceeding. (6) When any documentary material has been produced by any person under this section for use in any racketeering investigation, and no such case or proceeding arising therefrom has been instituted within a reasonable time after completion of the examination and analysis of all evidence assembled in the course of such investigation, such person shall be entitled, upon written demand made upon the Attorney General, to the return of all documentary material other than copies thereof made pursuant to this subsection so produced by such person. (7) In the event of the death, disability, or separation from service of the custodian of any documentary material produced under any demand issued under this section or the official relief of such custodian from responsibility for the custody and control of such material, the Attorney General shall promptly— (i) designate another racketeering investigator to serve as custodian thereof, and (ii) transmit notice in writing to the person who produced such material as to the identity and address of the successor so designated. Any successor so designated shall have with regard to such materials all duties and responsibilities imposed by this section upon his predecessor in office with regard thereto, except that he shall not be held responsible for any default or dereliction which occurred before his designation as custodian. (g) Whenever any person fails to comply with any civil investigative demand duly served upon him under this section or whenever satisfactory copying or reproduction of any such material cannot be done and such person refuses to surrender such material, the Attorney General may file, in the district court of the United States for any judicial district in which such person resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon such person a petition for an order of such court for the enforcement of this section, except that if such person transacts business in more than one such district such petition shall be filed in the district in which such person maintains his principal place of business, or in such other district in which such person transacts business as may be agreed upon by the parties to such petition. (h) Within twenty days after the service of any such demand upon any person, or at any time before the return date specified in the demand, whichever period is shorter, such person may file, in the district court of the United States for the judicial district within which such person resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon such custodian a petition for an order of such court modifying or setting aside such demand. The time allowed for compliance with the demand in whole or in part as deemed proper and ordered by the court shall not run during the pendency of such petition in the court. Such petition shall specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in seeking such relief, and may be based upon any failure of such demand to comply with the provisions of this section or upon any constitutional or other legal right or privilege of such person. (i) At any time during which any custodian is in custody or control of any documentary material delivered by any person in compliance with any such demand, such person may file, in the district court of the United States for the judicial district within which the office of such custodian is situated, and serve upon such custodian a petition for an order of such court requiring the performance by such custodian of any duty imposed upon him by this section. (j) Whenever any petition is filed in any district court of the United States under this section, such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter so presented, and to enter such order or orders as may be required to carry into effect the provisions of this section.

Entering train to commit crime. 1992. Terrorist attacks and other violence against railroad carriers and against mass transportation systems on land, on water, or through the air. Historical and Revision Notes This chapter does not include motor busses, interstate trucking facilities or airplanes within the protection of existing law. Motor busses and trucks already carry a huge amount of interstate commerce. It is reasonable to presume that much interstate freight and express will soon be carried by air. Attention is directed to the consideration of the extension of the laws now applicable only to railroads to these other interstate facilities. 80th Congress House Report No. 304.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on sections 588a, 588b, 588c, of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ( May 18, 1934, ch. 304, §§1, 2, 3, 48 Stat. 783 ; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §333, 49 Stat. 720 ; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 747, 50 Stat. 749 ; June 29, 1940, ch. 455, 54 Stat. 695 ). Section consolidates sections 588a, 588b, and 588c of title 12 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, as suggested by United States Attorney Clyde O. Eastus, of Fort Worth, Tex. Words "felony or larceny" in subsection (a) were changed to "felony affecting such bank and in violation of any statute of the United States, or any larceny". Use of term "felony" without limitation caused confusion as to whether a common law, State, or Federal felony was intended. Change conforms with Jerome v. U.S . (1943, 63 S. Ct. 483, 318 U.S. 101, 87 L. Ed. 640): "§2(a) [§588b(a) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking] is not deprived of vitality if it is interpreted to exclude State felonies and to include only those Federal felonies which affect banks protected by the Act." Minimum punishment provisions were omitted from subsection (c). (See reviser's note under section 203 of this title .) Also the provisions of subsection (b) measuring the punishment by the amount involved were extended and made applicable to the receiver as well as the thief. There seems no good reason why the thief of less than $100 should be liable to a maximum of imprisonment for one year and the receiver subject to 10 years. The figures "100" were substituted for "50" in view of the fact that the present worth of $100 is less than the value of $50 when that sum was fixed as the dividing line between petit larceny and grand larceny. The attention of Congress is directed to the mandatory minimum punishment provisions of sections 2113(e) and 2114 of this title . These were left unchanged because of the controversial question involved. Such legislative attempts to control the discretion of the sentencing judge are contrary to the opinions of experienced criminologists and criminal law experts. They are calculated to work manifest injustice in many cases. Necessary minor translations of section references, and changes in phraseology, were made.

( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 801 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 704 of title 46 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping ( R.S. §4602 ). Words "officer, radio operator," and "or other person employed on" were inserted at beginning of section to insure clarity and scope of section. Section 701 of title 46 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping, is very similar to this section as revised, and has been applied to mates [ Morris v. Cornell , D.C. Mass. 1843, Fed. Cas. No. 9,829; Gladding v. Constant , D.C. Mass. 1844, Fed. Cas. No. 5,468; Foye v. Dabney , D.C. Mass. 1853, Fed. Cas. No. 5,022; Foye v. Lickie , D.C. Mass. 1853, Fed. Cas.

(See notes of decisions under section 701, of title 46 , U.S.C., Shipping.) Words "be guilty of a misdemeanor" were omitted as unnecessary in view of general definition of "misdemeanor" in section 1 of this title . Minor changes were made in phraseology including substitution of "one year" for "twelve months" at end of section. §2197. Misuse of Federal certificate, license or document Whoever, not being lawfully entitled thereto, uses, exhibits, or attempts to use or exhibit, or, with intent unlawfully to use the same, receives or possesses any certificate, license, or document issued to vessels, or officers or seamen by any officer or employee of the United States authorized by law to issue the same; or Whoever, without authority, alters or attempts to alter any such certificate, license, or document by addition, interpolation, deletion, or erasure; or Whoever forges, counterfeits, or steals, or attempts to forge, counterfeit, or steal, any such certificate, license, or document; or unlawfully possesses or knowingly uses any such altered, changed, forged, counterfeit, or stolen certificate, license, or document; or Whoever, without authority, prints or manufactures any blank form of such certificate, license, or document, or Whoever possesses without lawful excuse, and with intent unlawfully to use the same, any blank form of such certificate, license, or document; or Whoever, in any manner, transfers or negotiates such transfer of, any blank form of such certificate, license, or document, or any such altered, forged, counterfeit, or stolen certificate, license, or document, or any such certificate, license, or document to which the party transferring or receiving the same is not lawfully entitled— Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 801 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 710a of title 46 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping ( June 25, 1936, ch. 816, §6, 49 Stat. 1936 ). The phrase "the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation," identifying the agency issuing the certificate, license or document, was omitted without change of substance. The functions of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were transferred to the Bureau of Customs and the Coast Guard by Executive Order 9083 Feb. 28, 1942, title 50, App. U.S.C., 1940 ed., following §601. Such transfer is temporary under section 621 of title 50 , App., U.S.C., 1940 ed. (First War Powers Act). As revised the section is broad enough to embrace certificates, licenses and documents issued by the officers or employees of the Coast Guard and Customs Service, as the case may be. Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or abetting was omitted as such persons are principals under section 2 of this title . Words "upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured. Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000" in last par. [§2198. Repealed. Pub.

Stowaways on vessels or aircraft Whoever, without the consent of the owner, charterer, master, or person in command of any vessel, or aircraft, with intent to obtain transportation, boards, enters or secretes himself aboard such vessel or aircraft and is thereon at the time of departure of said vessel or aircraft from a port, harbor, wharf, airport or other place within the jurisdiction of the United States; or Whoever, with like intent, having boarded, entered or secreted himself aboard a vessel or aircraft at any place within or without the jurisdiction of the United States, remains aboard after the vessel or aircraft has left such place and is thereon at any place within the jurisdiction of the United States; or Whoever, with intent to obtain a ride or transportation, boards or enters any aircraft owned or operated by the United States without the consent of the person in command or other duly authorized officer or agent— (1) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both; (2) if the person commits an act proscribed by this section, with the intent to commit serious bodily injury, and serious bodily injury occurs (as defined under section 1365, including any conduct that, if the conduct occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, would violate section 2241 or 2242) to any person other than a participant as a result of a violation of this section, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both; and (3) if an individual commits an act proscribed by this section, with the intent to cause death, and if the death of any person other than a participant occurs as a result of a violation of this section, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for any number of years or for life, or both. The word "aircraft" as used in this section includes any contrivance for navigation or flight in the air. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 802 ; Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§469–474 ( June 11, 1940, ch. 326, §§1–3, 54 Stat. 306 ; Mar. 4, 1944, ch. 82, §§1–4, 58 Stat. 111 ; Apr. 10, 1944, ch. 162, 58 Stat. 188 ). Sections consolidated and rewritten with changes of phraseology and substance. In section 469 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., the element of intent not to pay for transportation was omitted as unnecessary since the payment of transportation will invariably remove the stowaway from the operation of the section by purchasing the master's "consent". In section 472 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., the enumerations of State, Territory, Possession, District of Columbia, and The Canal Zone, was omitted as adequately covered by "place within the jurisdiction of the United States." The punishment provision is the same as in sections 470, 472, and 473 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., but the fine is $500 more than the maximum fine provided by said section 469. There seemed no point, however, in preserving a differential in favor of the stowaway as against the aider and abettor of $500. The court can be trusted to exercise a wise discretion within the slightly larger limits provided by the revised section. The provision for punishment of aiders and abettors in section 470 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as unnecessary since they are punishable as principals by section 2 of this title . Sections 471 and 474 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as obviously unnecessary. Editorial Notes Amendments 2006 — Pub. L. 109–177 added pars. (1) to (3) and struck out former fourth undesignated par. which read as follows: "Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both." 1996 — Pub. L. 104–294 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $1,000" in fourth undesignated par. CHAPTER 109 —SEARCHES AND SEIZURES Sec. 2231. Assault or resistance. 2232.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§121, 253, 254, 628 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §65, 35 Stat. 1100 ; June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title XI, §18, 40 Stat. 230 ; May 18, 1934, ch. 299, §§1, 2, 48 Stat. 780 , 781 ; Feb. 8, 1936, ch. 40, 49 Stat. 1105 ; June 26, 1936, ch. 830, title I, §3, 49 Stat. 1940 ; Reorg. Plan No. II, §4(f), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 Fed. Reg. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433 ; June 13, 1940, ch. 359, 54 Stat. 391 ). Section consolidates section 628 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the portion of section 121 of said title relating to resistance of persons authorized to make searches. Punishment provided by section 121 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., was $2,000 fine and imprisonment for 1 year. Section 628 of said title was part of Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title XIII, §1, 40 Stat. 231 , prescribing fine of not more than $1,000 and imprisonment not exceeding 2 years for resisting service, execution of search warrant, or assaulting an officer. Section 253 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., enumerated United States marshals, deputies, and assistants, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, and numerous other officers, the killing of whom is denounced as a Federal offense. Section 254 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., denounced the assaulting of such officers and prescribed punishment therefor without regard to nature of duties involved or performed. In other words sections 253 and 254 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were not limited to officers executing search warrants. Officers enumerated in section 253 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., were substantially all those who serve or execute search warrants. Therefore, the language and punishment under section 254 of said title constitute basis of this revised section. No change in legislative intent is involved, as the amendments of sections 253 and 254 of said title are the latest enactments. The provisions of section 121 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to rescue of property from seizing officer or its destruction to prevent seizure, are incorporated in sections 2232 and 2233 of this title . Minor changes were made in translation and phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 —Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 103–322, §330016(1)(K), substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $5,000". Subsec. (b). Pub.

(c) Notice of Search or Execution of Seizure Warrant or Warrant of Arrest In Rem .—Whoever, having knowledge that any person authorized to make searches and seizures, or to execute a seizure warrant or warrant of arrest in rem, in order to prevent the authorized seizing or securing of any person or property, gives notice or attempts to give notice in advance of the search, seizure, or execution of a seizure warrant or warrant of arrest in rem, to any person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.

Section was formed from the words following the first semicolon and ending with the second semicolon, in section 121 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. The remaining provisions of section 121 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to assaulting, resisting, or interfering with customs officers, revenue officers, or other persons, and to the rescue of seized property, constitute, along with provisions from other sections, sections 2231 and 2233 of this title . Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes References in Text The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, referred to in subsec. (e), is Pub.

( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 802 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(I), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§121, 128 ( Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§65, 71, 35 Stat. 1100 , 1101 ). Section consolidates that portion of section 121 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to rescue of seized property, with section 128 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed. The remaining provisions of section 121 of present title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to assaulting, resisting, or interfering with customs officers, revenue officers, or other persons, and to the destruction or removal of property to prevent seizure, constitute sections 2231 and 2232 of this title , the former provisions being consolidated with certain provisions of other sections. Said section 121 of present title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for punishment by fine of not more than $2,000 or imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or both, of persons rescuing, attempting to rescue, or causing to be rescued, "any property" which has been seized by "any person" authorized to make searches and seizures. Said section 128 of present title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for punishment by fine of not more than $300 and imprisonment for not more than 1 year of persons dispossessing, rescuing, or attempting to dispossess or rescue, or aiding or assisting in dispossessing or rescuing, "any property taken or detained by any officer or other person under the authority of any revenue law of the United States." This revised section adopts the maximum fine provisions of section 121 of title 18 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., and extends the maximum term of imprisonment to 2 years. This was deemed advisable so that uniformity of punishment would be established and the provisions would be sufficiently broad to impose punishment commensurate with the gravity of the offense. (See section 3601(c)(2) of title 26 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code.) Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title . Changes were made in phraseology.

This section shall not apply to any person— (a) serving a warrant of arrest; or (b) arresting or attempting to arrest a person committing or attempting to commit an offense in his presence, or who has committed or is suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed a felony; or (c) making a search at the request or invitation or with the consent of the occupant of the premises.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §53a ( Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 740, §201, 49 Stat. 877 ). Words "or any department or agency thereof" were inserted to avoid ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive section 6 of this title .) The exception in the case of an invitation or the consent of the occupant, was inserted to make the section complete and remove any doubt as to the application of this section to searches which have uniformly been upheld. Reference to misdemeanor was omitted in view of definitive section 1 of this title . (See reviser's note under section 212 of this title .) Words "upon conviction thereof shall be" were omitted as surplusage, since punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured. Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 2002 — Pub. L. 107–273 inserted "under this title" after "warrant, shall be fined" and struck out "not more than $1,000" after "for a first offense". 1996 — Pub.

Congressional Findings Pub. L. 110–358, title I, §102, Oct. 8, 2008, 122 Stat. 4001 , provided that: "Congress finds the following: "(1) Child pornography is estimated to be a multibillion dollar industry of global proportions, facilitated by the growth of the Internet. "(2) Data has shown that 83 percent of child pornography possessors had images of children younger than 12 years old, 39 percent had images of children younger than 6 years old, and 19 percent had images of children younger than 3 years old. "(3) Child pornography is a permanent record of a child's abuse and the distribution of child pornography images revictimizes the child each time the image is viewed. "(4) Child pornography is readily available through virtually every Internet technology, including Web sites, email, instant messaging, Internet Relay Chat, newsgroups, bulletin boards, and peer-to-peer. "(5) The technological ease, lack of expense, and anonymity in obtaining and distributing child pornography over the Internet has resulted in an explosion in the multijurisdictional distribution of child pornography. "(6) The Internet is well recognized as a method of distributing goods and services across State lines. "(7) The transmission of child pornography using the Internet constitutes transportation in interstate commerce." Pub. L. 109–248, title V, §501, July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 623 , provided that: "Congress makes the following findings: "(1) The effect of the intrastate production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography on the interstate market in child pornography: "(A) The illegal production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising and possession of child pornography, as defined in section 2256(8) of title 18, United States Code , as well as the transfer of custody of children for the production of child pornography, is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the children depicted in child pornography and has a substantial and detrimental effect on society as a whole. "(B) A substantial interstate market in child pornography exists, including not only a multimillion dollar industry, but also a nationwide network of individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit children and to traffic in child pornography. Many of these individuals distribute child pornography with the expectation of receiving other child pornography in return. "(C) The interstate market in child pornography is carried on to a substantial extent through the mails and other instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, such as the Internet. The advent of the Internet has greatly increased the ease of transporting, distributing, receiving, and advertising child pornography in interstate commerce. The advent of digital cameras and digital video cameras, as well as videotape cameras, has greatly increased the ease of producing child pornography. The advent of inexpensive computer equipment with the capacity to store large numbers of digital images of child pornography has greatly increased the ease of possessing child pornography. Taken together, these technological advances have had the unfortunate result of greatly increasing the interstate market in child pornography. "(D) Intrastate incidents of production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the transfer of custody of children for the production of child pornography, have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because: "(i) Some persons engaged in the production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography conduct such activities entirely within the boundaries of one state. These persons are unlikely to be content with the amount of child pornography they produce, transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or possess. These persons are therefore likely to enter the interstate market in child pornography in search of additional child pornography, thereby stimulating demand in the interstate market in child pornography. "(ii) When the persons described in subparagraph (D)(i) enter the interstate market in search of additional child pornography, they are likely to distribute the child pornography they already produce, transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or possess to persons who will distribute additional child pornography to them, thereby stimulating supply in the interstate market in child pornography. "(iii) Much of the child pornography that supplies the interstate market in child pornography is produced entirely within the boundaries of one state, is not traceable, and enters the interstate market surreptitiously. This child pornography supports demand in the interstate market in child pornography and is essential to its existence. "(E) Prohibiting the intrastate production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the intrastate transfer of custody of children for the production of child pornography, will cause some persons engaged in such intrastate activities to cease all such activities, thereby reducing both supply and demand in the interstate market for child pornography. "(F) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the intrastate transfer of children for the production of child pornography, is essential to the effective control of the interstate market in child pornography. "(2) The importance of protecting children from repeat exploitation in child pornography: "(A) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions today involve images contained on computer hard drives, computer disks, and related media. "(B) Child pornography is not entitled to protection under the First Amendment and thus may be prohibited. "(C) The government has a compelling State interest in protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, and this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain. "(D) Every instance of viewing images of child pornography represents a renewed violation of the privacy of the victims and a repetition of their abuse. "(E) Child pornography constitutes prima facie contraband, and as such should not be distributed to, or copied by, child pornography defendants or their attorneys. "(F) It is imperative to prohibit the reproduction of child pornography in criminal cases so as to avoid repeated violation and abuse of victims, so long as the government makes reasonable accommodations for the inspection, viewing, and examination of such material for the purposes of mounting a criminal defense." Pub. L. 108–21, title V, §501, Apr. 30, 2003, 117 Stat. 676 , provided that: "Congress finds the following: "(1) Obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to protection under the First Amendment under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity), or New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography) and thus may be prohibited. "(2) The Government has a compelling state interest in protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, including both child molesters and child pornographers. 'The prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance,' New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982), and this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110 (1990). "(3) The Government thus has a compelling interest in ensuring that the criminal prohibitions against child pornography remain enforceable and effective. 'The most expeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.' Ferber, 458 U.S. at 760. "(4) In 1982, when the Supreme Court decided Ferber, the technology did not exist to— "(A) computer generate depictions of children that are indistinguishable from depictions of real children; "(B) use parts of images of real children to create a composite image that is unidentifiable as a particular child and in a way that prevents even an expert from concluding that parts of images of real children were used; or "(C) disguise pictures of real children being abused by making the image look computer-generated. "(5) Evidence submitted to the Congress, including from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, demonstrates that technology already exists to disguise depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and to make depictions of real children appear computer-generated. The technology will soon exist, if it does not already, to computer generate realistic images of children. "(6) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions today involve images contained on computer hard drives, computer disks, and/or related media. "(7) There is no substantial evidence that any of the child pornography images being trafficked today were made other than by the abuse of real children. Nevertheless, technological advances since Ferber have led many criminal defendants to suggest that the images of child pornography they possess are not those of real children, insisting that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the images are not computer-generated. Such challenges increased significantly after the decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002). "(8) Child pornography circulating on the Internet has, by definition, been digitally uploaded or scanned into computers and has been transferred over the Internet, often in different file formats, from trafficker to trafficker. An image seized from a collector of child pornography is rarely a first-generation product, and the retransmission of images can alter the image so as to make it difficult for even an expert conclusively to opine that a particular image depicts a real child. If the original image has been scanned from a paper version into a digital format, this task can be even harder since proper forensic assessment may depend on the quality of the image scanned and the tools used to scan it. "(9) The impact of the Free Speech Coalition decision on the Government's ability to prosecute child pornography offenders is already evident. The Ninth Circuit has seen a significant adverse effect on prosecutions since the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Free Speech Coalition. After that decision, prosecutions generally have been brought in the Ninth Circuit only in the most clear-cut cases in which the government can specifically identify the child in the depiction or otherwise identify the origin of the image. This is a fraction of meritorious child pornography cases. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children testified that, in light of the Supreme Court's affirmation of the Ninth Circuit decision, prosecutors in various parts of the country have expressed concern about the continued viability of previously indicted cases as well as declined potentially meritorious prosecutions. "(10) Since the Supreme Court's decision in Free Speech Coalition, defendants in child pornography cases have almost universally raised the contention that the images in question could be virtual, thereby requiring the government, in nearly every child pornography prosecution, to find proof that the child is real. Some of these defense efforts have already been successful. In addition, the number of prosecutions being brought has been significantly and adversely affected as the resources required to be dedicated to each child pornography case now are significantly higher than ever before. "(11) Leading experts agree that, to the extent that the technology exists to computer generate realistic images of child pornography, the cost in terms of time, money, and expertise is—and for the foreseeable future will remain—prohibitively expensive. As a result, for the foreseeable future, it will be more cost-effective to produce child pornography using real children. It will not, however, be difficult or expensive to use readily available technology to disguise those depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable or to make them appear computer-generated. "(12) Child pornography results from the abuse of real children by sex offenders; the production of child pornography is a byproduct of, and not the primary reason for, the sexual abuse of children. There is no evidence that the future development of easy and inexpensive means of computer generating realistic images of children would stop or even reduce the sexual abuse of real children or the practice of visually recording that abuse. "(13) In the absence of congressional action, the difficulties in enforcing the child pornography laws will continue to grow increasingly worse. The mere prospect that the technology exists to create composite or computer-generated depictions that are indistinguishable from depictions of real children will allow defendants who possess images of real children to escape prosecution; for it threatens to create a reasonable doubt in every case of computer images even when a real child was abused. This threatens to render child pornography laws that protect real children unenforceable. Moreover, imposing an additional requirement that the Government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the image was in fact a real child—as some courts have done—threatens to result in the de facto legalization of the possession, receipt, and distribution of child pornography for all except the original producers of the material. "(14) To avoid this grave threat to the Government's unquestioned compelling interest in effective enforcement of the child pornography laws that protect real children, a statute must be adopted that prohibits a narrowly-defined subcategory of images. "(15) The Supreme Court's 1982 Ferber v. New York decision holding that child pornography was not protected drove child pornography off the shelves of adult bookstores. Congressional action is necessary now to ensure that open and notorious trafficking in such materials does not reappear, and even increase, on the Internet." Pub. L. 104–208, div. A, title I, §101(a) [title I, §121[1]], Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–26 , provided that: "Congress finds that— "(1) the use of children in the production of sexually explicit material, including photographs, films, videos, computer images, and other visual depictions, is a form of sexual abuse which can result in physical or psychological harm, or both, to the children involved; "(2) where children are used in its production, child pornography permanently records the victim's abuse, and its continued existence causes the child victims of sexual abuse continuing harm by haunting those children in future years; "(3) child pornography is often used as part of a method of seducing other children into sexual activity; a child who is reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to pose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be convinced by viewing depictions of other children 'having fun' participating in such activity; "(4) child pornography is often used by pedophiles and child sexual abusers to stimulate and whet their own sexual appetites, and as a model for sexual acting out with children; such use of child pornography can desensitize the viewer to the pathology of sexual abuse or exploitation of children, so that it can become acceptable to and even preferred by the viewer; "(5) new photographic and computer imagining [sic] technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical, or other means, visual depictions of what appear to be children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct; "(6) computers and computer imaging technology can be used to— "(A) alter sexually explicit photographs, films, and videos in such a way as to make it virtually impossible for unsuspecting viewers to identify individuals, or to determine if the offending material was produced using children; "(B) produce visual depictions of child sexual activity designed to satisfy the preferences of individual child molesters, pedophiles, and pornography collectors; and "(C) alter innocent pictures of children to create visual depictions of those children engaging in sexual conduct; "(7) the creation or distribution of child pornography which includes an image of a recognizable minor invades the child's privacy and reputational interests, since images that are created showing a child's face or other identifiable feature on a body engaging in sexually explicit conduct can haunt the minor for years to come; "(8) the effect of visual depictions of child sexual activity on a child molester or pedophile using that material to stimulate or whet his own sexual appetites, or on a child where the material is being used as a means of seducing or breaking down the child's inhibitions to sexual abuse or exploitation, is the same whether the child pornography consists of photographic depictions of actual children or visual depictions produced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or other means, including by computer, which are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from photographic images of actual children; "(9) the danger to children who are seduced and molested with the aid of child sex pictures is just as great when the child pornographer or child molester uses visual depictions of child sexual activity produced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or other means, including by computer, as when the material consists of unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct; "(10)(A) the existence of and traffic in child pornographic images creates the potential for many types of harm in the community and presents a clear and present danger to all children; and "(B) it inflames the desires of child molesters, pedophiles, and child pornographers who prey on children, thereby increasing the creation and distribution of child pornography and the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children who are victimized as a result of the existence and use of these materials; "(11)(A) the sexualization and eroticization of minors through any form of child pornographic images has a deleterious effect on all children by encouraging a societal perception of children as sexual objects and leading to further sexual abuse and exploitation of them; and "(B) this sexualization of minors creates an unwholesome environment which affects the psychological, mental and emotional development of children and undermines the efforts of parents and families to encourage the sound mental, moral and emotional development of children; "(12) prohibiting the possession and viewing of child pornography will encourage the possessors of such material to rid themselves of or destroy the material, thereby helping to protect the victims of child pornography and to eliminate the market for the sexual exploitative use of children; and "(13) the elimination of child pornography and the protection of children from sexual exploitation provide a compelling governmental interest for prohibiting the production, distribution, possession, sale, or viewing of visual depictions of children engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including both photographic images of actual children engaging in such conduct and depictions produced by computer or other means which are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from photographic images of actual children engaging in such conduct."

L. 104–132 effective, to extent constitutionally permissible, for sentencing proceedings in cases in which defendant is convicted on or after Apr. 24, 1996, see section 211 of Pub. L. 104–132, set out as a note under section 2248 of this title . Findings Pub. L. 115–299, §2, Dec. 7, 2018, 132 Stat. 4383 , provided that: "Congress finds the following: "(1) The demand for child pornography harms children because it drives production, which involves severe child sexual abuse and exploitation. "(2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not end, with child sex assault because child pornography is a permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those images compounds the harm to the child. "(3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court recognized that 'every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse'. "(4) The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children has stated that for victims of child pornography, 'the sexual abuse of the child, the memorialization of that abuse which becomes child pornography, and its subsequent distribution and viewing become psychologically intertwined and each compound the harm suffered by the child-victim'. "(5) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals have viewed and will in the future view images of their childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason that child pornography is outlawed. "(6) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a victim's childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining and aggravating the harms to that individual victim. "(7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child pornography be compensated for the harms resulting from every perpetrator who contributes to their anguish. Such an aggregate causation standard reflects the nature of child pornography and the unique ways that it actually harms victims." §2259A. Assessments in child pornography cases (a) In General .—In addition to any other criminal penalty, restitution, or special assessment authorized by law, the court shall assess— (1) not more than $17,000 on any person convicted of an offense under section 2252(a)(4) or 2252A(a)(5); (2) not more than $35,000 on any person convicted of any other offense for trafficking in child pornography; and (3) not more than $50,000 on any person convicted of a child pornography production offense. (b) Annual Adjustment .—The dollar amounts in subsection (a) shall be adjusted annually in conformity with the Consumer Price Index. (c) Factors Considered .—In determining the amount of the assessment under subsection (a), the court shall consider the factors set forth in sections 3553(a) and 3572. (d) Imposition and Implementation.— (1) In general .—The provisions of subchapter C of chapter 227 (other than section 3571) and subchapter B of chapter 229 (relating to fines) apply to assessments under this section, except that paragraph (2) applies in lieu of any contrary provisions of law relating to fines or disbursement of money received from a defendant. (2) Effect on other penalties .—Imposition of an assessment under this section does not relieve a defendant of, or entitle a defendant to reduce the amount of any other penalty by the amount of the assessment. Any money received from a defendant shall be disbursed so that each of the following obligations is paid in full in the following sequence: (A) A special assessment under section 3013. (B) Restitution to victims of any child pornography production or trafficking offense that the defendant committed. (C) An assessment under this section. (D) Other orders under any other section of this title. (E) All other fines, penalties, costs, and other payments required under the sentence. (Added Pub.

(b) Availability for Defined Monetary Assistance .—Amounts in the Child Pornography Victims Reserve shall be available for payment of defined monetary assistance pursuant to section 2259(d). If at any time the Child Pornography Victims Reserve has insufficient funds to make all of the payments ordered under section 2259(d), the Child Pornography Victims Reserve shall make such payments as it can satisfy in full from available funds. In determining the order in which such payments shall be made, the Child Pornography Victims Reserve shall make payments based on the date they were ordered, with the earliest-ordered payments made first. (c) Administration .—The Attorney General shall administer the Child Pornography Victims Reserve and shall issue guidelines and regulations to implement this section. (d) Sense of Congress .—It is the sense of Congress that individuals who violate this chapter prior to the date of the enactment of the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018, but who are sentenced after such date, shall be subject to the statutory scheme that was in effect at the time the offenses were committed.

Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 171 of title 46 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping ( Aug. 2, 1882, ch. 374, §8, 22 Stat. 189 ). Words "except as otherwise expressly provided by law" were inserted to remove obvious inconsistency between sections 831–835 of this title , section 170 of title 46 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping, and this section. Words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and" were omitted because designation of the offense as a misdemeanor is unnecessary in view of definitive section 1 of this title . Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative. Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes References in Text Section 151 of Title 46 , referred to in text, which was based on section 1 of act Aug. 2, 1882, ch. 374, 22 Stat. 186 , was repealed by Pub.

The master of such vessel may take any such person into custody, and deliver him up forthwith to any law enforcement officer, to be by him taken before any committing magistrate, to be dealt with according to law. ( June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 805 ; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(D), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2146 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on section 708 of title 46 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping ( R.S. §4606 ). "Law enforcement officer" was substituted for "constable or police officer" and "committing magistrate" for "justice of the peace." The phraseology used in the statute was archaic. It originated when the government had few law enforcement officers and magistrates of its own. References to specific sections were made to read: "according to law" to achieve brevity. Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative. The words "without permission of the master" were deleted to remove an inconsistency with the provisions of section 163 of title 46 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., and customs regulations. Customs regulations, 1943, section 4.1c, prohibit any person "with or without consent of the master" from boarding vessel, with specific enumerated exceptions. Said section 163 prescribes a "penalty of not more than $100 or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both" for violating regulations. The revised section increases the fine from $100 to $200 for boarding the vessel "with the consent of the master." Minor changes were made in phraseology. Editorial Notes Amendments 1994 — Pub.

"(5) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the United States, provides the proper legal framework for how such liability should function in the context of chapter 113B of title 18, United States Code .

Effective Date of 1996 Amendment Amendment by section 604(b)(33) of Pub. L. 104–294 effective Sept. 13, 1994, see section 604(d) of Pub. L. 104–294, set out as a note under section 13 of this title . Sense of Congress Pub. L. 118–31, div. E, title LI, §5102(b), Dec. 22, 2023, 137 Stat. 933 , provided that: "The sense of Congress is the following: "(1) The safety of children should be a top priority for public officials and communities in the United States. "(2) According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, an individual in the United States is sexually assaulted every 68 seconds. And every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. Meanwhile, only 25 out of every 1,000 perpetrators will end up in prison. "(3) The effects of child sexual abuse can be long-lasting and affect the victim's mental health. "(4) Victims are more likely than non-victims to experience the following mental health challenges: "(A) Victims are about 4 times more likely to develop symptoms of drug abuse. "(B) Victims are about 4 times more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder as adults. "(C) Victims are about 3 times more likely to experience a major depressive episode as adults. "(5) The criminal justice system should and has acted as an important line of defense to protect children and hold perpetrators accountable. "(6) However, the horrific crimes perpetuated by Larry Nassar demonstrate firsthand the loopholes that still exist in the criminal justice system. While Larry Nassar was found guilty of several State-level offenses, he was not charged federally for his illicit sexual contact with minors, despite crossing State and international borders to commit this conduct. "(7) The Department of Justice has also identified a growing trend of Americans who use charitable or missionary work in a foreign country as a cover for sexual abuse of children. "(8) It is the intent of Congress to prohibit Americans from engaging in sexual abuse or exploitation of minors under the guise of work, including volunteer work, with an organization that affects interstate or foreign commerce, such as an international charity. "(9) Federal law does not require that an abuser's intention to engage in sexual abuse be a primary, significant, dominant, or motivating purpose of the travel. "(10) Child sexual abuse does not require physical contact between the abuser and the child. This is especially true as perpetrators turn increasingly to internet platforms, online chat rooms, and webcams to commit child sexual abuse. "(11) However, a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found the use of a webcam to engage in sexually provocative activity with a minor did not qualify as 'sexual activity'. "(12) Congress can address this issue by amending the definition of the term 'sexual activity' to clarify that it does not require interpersonal, physical contact. "(13) It is the duty of Congress to provide clearer guidance to ensure that those who commit crimes against children are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law." §2424. Filing factual statement about alien individual (a) Whoever keeps, maintains, controls, supports, or harbors in any house or place for the purpose of prostitution, or for any other immoral purpose, any individual, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the individual is an alien, shall file with the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization a statement in writing setting forth the name of such individual, the place at which that individual is kept, and all facts as to the date of that individual's entry into the United States, the port through which that individual entered, that individual's age, nationality, and parentage, and concerning that individual's procuration to come to this country within the knowledge of such person; and Whoever fails within five business days after commencing to keep, maintain, control, support, or harbor in any house or place for the purpose of prostitution, or for any other immoral purpose, any alien individual to file such statement concerning such alien individual with the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization; or Whoever knowingly and willfully states falsely or fails to disclose in such statement any fact within that person's knowledge or belief with reference to the age, nationality, or parentage of any such alien individual, or concerning that individual's procuration to come to this country— Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both. (b) In any prosecution brought under this section, if it appears that any such statement required is not on file in the office of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, the person whose duty it is to file such statement shall be presumed to have failed to file said statement, unless such person or persons shall prove otherwise. No person shall be excused from furnishing the statement, as required by this section, on the ground or for the reason that the statement so required by that person, or the information therein contained, might tend to criminate that person or subject that person to a penalty or forfeiture, but no information contained in the statement or any evidence which is directly or indirectly derived from such information may be used against any person making such statement in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement or otherwise failing to comply with this section.

Congressional Findings Pub. L. 90–351, title III, §801, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 211 , provided that: "On the basis of its own investigations and of published studies, the Congress makes the following findings: "(a) Wire communications are normally conducted through the use of facilities which form part of an interstate network. The same facilities are used for interstate and intrastate communications. There has been extensive wiretapping carried on without legal sanctions, and without the consent of any of the parties to the conversation. Electronic, mechanical, and other intercepting devices are being used to overhear oral conversations made in private, without the consent of any of the parties to such communications. The contents of these communications and evidence derived therefrom are being used by public and private parties as evidence in court and administrative proceedings, and by persons whose activities affect interstate commerce. The possession, manufacture, distribution, advertising, and use of these devices are facilitated by interstate commerce. "(b) In order to protect effectively the privacy of wire and oral communications, to protect the integrity of court and administrative proceedings, and to prevent the obstruction of interstate commerce, it is necessary for Congress to define on a uniform basis the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized, to prohibit any unauthorized interception of such communications, and the use of the contents thereof in evidence in courts and administrative proceedings. "(c) Organized criminals make extensive use of wire and oral communications in their criminal activities. The interception of such communications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of justice. "(d) To safeguard the privacy of innocent persons, the interception of wire or oral communications where none of the parties to the communication has consented to the interception should be allowed only when authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction and should remain under the control and supervision of the authorizing court. Interception of wire and oral communications should further be limited to certain major types of offenses and specific categories of crime with assurances that the interception is justified and that the information obtained thereby will not be misused."

Procedure for interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications (1) Each application for an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication under this chapter shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to a judge of competent jurisdiction and shall state the applicant's authority to make such application. Each application shall include the following information: (a) the identity of the investigative or law enforcement officer making the application, and the officer authorizing the application; (b) a full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant, to justify his belief that an order should be issued, including (i) details as to the particular offense that has been, is being, or is about to be committed, (ii) except as provided in subsection (11), a particular description of the nature and location of the facilities from which or the place where the communication is to be intercepted, (iii) a particular description of the type of communications sought to be intercepted, (iv) the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted; (c) a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous; (d) a statement of the period of time for which the interception is required to be maintained. If the nature of the investigation is such that the authorization for interception should not automatically terminate when the described type of communication has been first obtained, a particular description of facts establishing probable cause to believe that additional communications of the same type will occur thereafter; (e) a full and complete statement of the facts concerning all previous applications known to the individual authorizing and making the application, made to any judge for authorization to intercept, or for approval of interceptions of, wire, oral, or electronic communications involving any of the same persons, facilities or places specified in the application, and the action taken by the judge on each such application; and (f) where the application is for the extension of an order, a statement setting forth the results thus far obtained from the interception, or a reasonable explanation of the failure to obtain such results. (2) The judge may require the applicant to furnish additional testimony or documentary evidence in support of the application. (3) Upon such application the judge may enter an ex parte order, as requested or as modified, authorizing or approving interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting (and outside that jurisdiction but within the United States in the case of a mobile interception device authorized by a Federal court within such jurisdiction), if the judge determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that— (a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense enumerated in section 2516 of this chapter ; (b) there is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception; (c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous; (d) except as provided in subsection (11), there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where, the wire, oral, or electronic communications are to be intercepted are being used, or are about to be used, in connection with the commission of such offense, or are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person. (4) Each order authorizing or approving the interception of any wire, oral, or electronic communication under this chapter shall specify— (a) the identity of the person, if known, whose communications are to be intercepted; (b) the nature and location of the communications facilities as to which, or the place where, authority to intercept is granted; (c) a particular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense to which it relates; (d) the identity of the agency authorized to intercept the communications, and of the person authorizing the application; and (e) the period of time during which such interception is authorized, including a statement as to whether or not the interception shall automatically terminate when the described communication has been first obtained. An order authorizing the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication under this chapter shall, upon request of the applicant, direct that a provider of wire or electronic communication service, landlord, custodian or other person shall furnish the applicant forthwith all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the interception unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services that such service provider, landlord, custodian, or person is according the person whose communications are to be intercepted. Any provider of wire or electronic communication service, landlord, custodian or other person furnishing such facilities or technical assistance shall be compensated therefor by the applicant for reasonable expenses incurred in providing such facilities or assistance. Pursuant to section 2522 of this chapter , an order may also be issued to enforce the assistance capability and capacity requirements under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. (5) No order entered under this section may authorize or approve the interception of any wire, oral, or electronic communication for any period longer than is necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization, nor in any event longer than thirty days. Such thirty-day period begins on the earlier of the day on which the investigative or law enforcement officer first begins to conduct an interception under the order or ten days after the order is entered. Extensions of an order may be granted, but only upon application for an extension made in accordance with subsection (1) of this section and the court making the findings required by subsection (3) of this section. The period of extension shall be no longer than the authorizing judge deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was granted and in no event for longer than thirty days. Every order and extension thereof shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter, and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event in thirty days. In the event the intercepted communication is in a code or foreign language, and an expert in that foreign language or code is not reasonably available during the interception period, minimization may be accomplished as soon as practicable after such interception. An interception under this chapter may be conducted in whole or in part by Government personnel, or by an individual operating under a contract with the Government, acting under the supervision of an investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception. (6) Whenever an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to this chapter, the order may require reports to be made to the judge who issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception. Such reports shall be made at such intervals as the judge may require. (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any investigative or law enforcement officer, specially designated by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, or by the principal prosecuting attorney of any State or subdivision thereof acting pursuant to a statute of that State, who reasonably determines that— (a) an emergency situation exists that involves— (i) immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person, (ii) conspiratorial activities threatening the national security interest, or (iii) conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime, that requires a wire, oral, or electronic communication to be intercepted before an order authorizing such interception can, with due diligence, be obtained, and (b) there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under this chapter to authorize such interception, may intercept such wire, oral, or electronic communication if an application for an order approving the interception is made in accordance with this section within forty-eight hours after the interception has occurred, or begins to occur. In the absence of an order, such interception shall immediately terminate when the communication sought is obtained or when the application for the order is denied, whichever is earlier. In the event such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the interception is terminated without an order having been issued, the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this chapter, and an inventory shall be served as provided for in subsection (d) of this section on the person named in the application. (8)(a) The contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted by any means authorized by this chapter shall, if possible, be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device. The recording of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication under this subsection shall be done in such a way as will protect the recording from editing or other alterations. Immediately upon the expiration of the period of the order, or extensions thereof, such recordings shall be made available to the judge issuing such order and sealed under his directions. Custody of the recordings shall be wherever the judge orders. They shall not be destroyed except upon an order of the issuing or denying judge and in any event shall be kept for ten years. Duplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of section 2517 of this chapter for investigations. The presence of the seal provided for by this subsection, or a satisfactory explanation for the absence thereof, shall be a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom under subsection (3) of section 2517. (b) Applications made and orders granted under this chapter shall be sealed by the judge. Custody of the applications and orders shall be wherever the judge directs. Such applications and orders shall be disclosed only upon a showing of good cause before a judge of competent jurisdiction and shall not be destroyed except on order of the issuing or denying judge, and in any event shall be kept for ten years. (c) Any violation of the provisions of this subsection may be punished as contempt of the issuing or denying judge. (d) Within a reasonable time but not later than ninety days after the filing of an application for an order of approval under section 2518(7)(b) which is denied or the termination of the period of an order or extensions thereof, the issuing or denying judge shall cause to be served, on the persons named in the order or the application, and such other parties to intercepted communications as the judge may determine in his discretion that is in the interest of justice, an inventory which shall include notice of— (1) the fact of the entry of the order or the application; (2) the date of the entry and the period of authorized, approved or disapproved interception, or the denial of the application; and (3) the fact that during the period wire, oral, or electronic communications were or were not intercepted. The judge, upon the filing of a motion, may in his discretion make available to such person or his counsel for inspection such portions of the intercepted communications, applications and orders as the judge determines to be in the interest of justice. On an ex parte showing of good cause to a judge of competent jurisdiction the serving of the inventory required by this subsection may be postponed. (9) The contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted pursuant to this chapter or evidence derived therefrom shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in a Federal or State court unless each party, not less than ten days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding, has been furnished with a copy of the court order, and accompanying application, under which the interception was authorized or approved. This ten-day period may be waived by the judge if he finds that it was not possible to furnish the party with the above information ten days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding and that the party will not be prejudiced by the delay in receiving such information. (10)(a) Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, may move to suppress the contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted pursuant to this chapter, or evidence derived therefrom, on the grounds that— (i) the communication was unlawfully intercepted; (ii) the order of authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or (iii) the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval. Such motion shall be made before the trial, hearing, or proceeding unless there was no opportunity to make such motion or the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion. If the motion is granted, the contents of the intercepted wire or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this chapter. The judge, upon the filing of such motion by the aggrieved person, may in his discretion make available to the aggrieved person or his counsel for inspection such portions of the intercepted communication or evidence derived therefrom as the judge determines to be in the interests of justice. (b) In addition to any other right to appeal, the United States shall have the right to appeal from an order granting a motion to suppress made under paragraph (a) of this subsection, or the denial of an application for an order of approval, if the United States attorney shall certify to the judge or other official granting such motion or denying such application that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty days after the date the order was entered and shall be diligently prosecuted. (c) The remedies and sanctions described in this chapter with respect to the interception of electronic communications are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this chapter involving such communications. (11) The requirements of subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(d) of this section relating to the specification of the facilities from which, or the place where, the communication is to be intercepted do not apply if— (a) in the case of an application with respect to the interception of an oral communication— (i) the application is by a Federal investigative or law enforcement officer and is approved by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or an acting Assistant Attorney General; (ii) the application contains a full and complete statement as to why such specification is not practical and identifies the person committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted; and (iii) the judge finds that such specification is not practical; and (b) in the case of an application with respect to a wire or electronic communication— (i) the application is by a Federal investigative or law enforcement officer and is approved by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or an acting Assistant Attorney General; (ii) the application identifies the person believed to be committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted and the applicant makes a showing that there is probable cause to believe that the person's actions could have the effect of thwarting interception from a specified facility; (iii) the judge finds that such showing has been adequately made; and (iv) the order authorizing or approving the interception is limited to interception only for such time as it is reasonable to presume that the person identified in the application is or was reasonably proximate to the instrument through which such communication will be or was transmitted. (12) An interception of a communication under an order with respect to which the requirements of subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(d) of this section do not apply by reason of subsection (11)(a) shall not begin until the place where the communication is to be intercepted is ascertained by the person implementing the interception order. A provider of wire or electronic communications service that has received an order as provided for in subsection (11)(b) may move the court to modify or quash the order on the ground that its assistance with respect to the interception cannot be performed in a timely or reasonable fashion. The court, upon notice to the government, shall decide such a motion expeditiously. (Added Pub. L. 90–351, title III, §802, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 218 ; amended Pub.

V, §102, Mar. 23, 2018, 132 Stat. 1213 , provided that: "Congress finds the following: "(1) Timely access to electronic data held by communications-service providers is an essential component of government efforts to protect public safety and combat serious crime, including terrorism. "(2) Such efforts by the United States Government are being impeded by the inability to access data stored outside the United States that is in the custody, control, or possession of communications-service providers that are subject to jurisdiction of the United States. "(3) Foreign governments also increasingly seek access to electronic data held by communications-service providers in the United States for the purpose of combating serious crime. "(4) Communications-service providers face potential conflicting legal obligations when a foreign government orders production of electronic data that United States law may prohibit providers from disclosing. "(5) Foreign law may create similarly conflicting legal obligations when chapter 121 of title 18, United States Code (commonly known as the 'Stored Communications Act'), requires disclosure of electronic data that foreign law prohibits communications-service providers from disclosing. "(6) International agreements provide a mechanism for resolving these potential conflicting legal obligations where the United States and the relevant foreign government share a common commitment to the rule of law and the protection of privacy and civil liberties."

(d) Requirements for Court Order .—A court order for disclosure under subsection (b) or (c) may be issued by any court that is a court of competent jurisdiction and shall issue only if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. In the case of a State governmental authority, such a court order shall not issue if prohibited by the law of such State. A court issuing an order pursuant to this section, on a motion made promptly by the service provider, may quash or modify such order, if the information or records requested are unusually voluminous in nature or compliance with such order otherwise would cause an undue burden on such provider. (e) No Cause of Action Against a Provider Disclosing Information Under This Chapter .—No cause of action shall lie in any court against any provider of wire or electronic communication service, its officers, employees, agents, or other specified persons for providing information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with the terms of a court order, warrant, subpoena, statutory authorization, or certification under this chapter.

(h) Comity Analysis and Disclosure of Information Regarding Legal Process Seeking Contents of Wire or Electronic Communication.— (1) Definitions .—In this subsection— (A) the term "qualifying foreign government" means a foreign government— (i) with which the United States has an executive agreement that has entered into force under section 2523; and (ii) the laws of which provide to electronic communication service providers and remote computing service providers substantive and procedural opportunities similar to those provided under paragraphs (2) and (5); and (B) the term "United States person" has the meaning given the term in section 2523. (2) Motions to quash or modify .—(A) A provider of electronic communication service to the public or remote computing service, including a foreign electronic communication service or remote computing service, that is being required to disclose pursuant to legal process issued under this section the contents of a wire or electronic communication of a subscriber or customer, may file a motion to modify or quash the legal process where the provider reasonably believes— (i) that the customer or subscriber is not a United States person and does not reside in the United States; and (ii) that the required disclosure would create a material risk that the provider would violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government. Such a motion shall be filed not later than 14 days after the date on which the provider was served with the legal process, absent agreement with the government or permission from the court to extend the deadline based on an application made within the 14 days. The right to move to quash is without prejudice to any other grounds to move to quash or defenses thereto, but it shall be the sole basis for moving to quash on the grounds of a conflict of law related to a qualifying foreign government. (B) Upon receipt of a motion filed pursuant to subparagraph (A), the court shall afford the governmental entity that applied for or issued the legal process under this section the opportunity to respond. The court may modify or quash the legal process, as appropriate, only if the court finds that— (i) the required disclosure would cause the provider to violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government; (ii) based on the totality of the circumstances, the interests of justice dictate that the legal process should be modified or quashed; and (iii) the customer or subscriber is not a United States person and does not reside in the United States. (3) Comity analysis .—For purposes of making a determination under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), the court shall take into account, as appropriate— (A) the interests of the United States, including the investigative interests of the governmental entity seeking to require the disclosure; (B) the interests of the qualifying foreign government in preventing any prohibited disclosure; (C) the likelihood, extent, and nature of penalties to the provider or any employees of the provider as a result of inconsistent legal requirements imposed on the provider; (D) the location and nationality of the subscriber or customer whose communications are being sought, if known, and the nature and extent of the subscriber or customer's connection to the United States, or if the legal process has been sought on behalf of a foreign authority pursuant to section 3512, the nature and extent of the subscriber or customer's connection to the foreign authority's country; (E) the nature and extent of the provider's ties to and presence in the United States; (F) the importance to the investigation of the information required to be disclosed; (G) the likelihood of timely and effective access to the information required to be disclosed through means that would cause less serious negative consequences; and (H) if the legal process has been sought on behalf of a foreign authority pursuant to section 3512, the investigative interests of the foreign authority making the request for assistance. (4) Disclosure obligations during pendency of challenge .—A service provider shall preserve, but not be obligated to produce, information sought during the pendency of a motion brought under this subsection, unless the court finds that immediate production is necessary to prevent an adverse result identified in section 2705(a)(2). (5) Disclosure to qualifying foreign government .—(A) It shall not constitute a violation of a protective order issued under section 2705 for a provider of electronic communication service to the public or remote computing service to disclose to the entity within a qualifying foreign government, designated in an executive agreement under section 2523, the fact of the existence of legal process issued under this section seeking the contents of a wire or electronic communication of a customer or subscriber who is a national or resident of the qualifying foreign government. (B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to modify or otherwise affect any other authority to make a motion to modify or quash a protective order issued under section 2705. (Added Pub.

(2) Notice to the subscriber or customer shall be made by the governmental entity within three days after receipt of such confirmation, unless such notice is delayed pursuant to section 2705(a).

(5) A governmental entity may seek to require the creation of a backup copy under subsection (a)(1) of this section if in its sole discretion such entity determines that there is reason to believe that notification under section 2703 of this title of the existence of the subpoena or court order may result in destruction of or tampering with evidence. This determination is not subject to challenge by the subscriber or customer or service provider. (b) Customer Challenges .—(1) Within fourteen days after notice by the governmental entity to the subscriber or customer under subsection (a)(2) of this section, such subscriber or customer may file a motion to quash such subpoena or vacate such court order, with copies served upon the governmental entity and with written notice of such challenge to the service provider. A motion to vacate a court order shall be filed in the court which issued such order. A motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed in the appropriate United States district court or State court. Such motion or application shall contain an affidavit or sworn statement— (A) stating that the applicant is a customer or subscriber to the service from which the contents of electronic communications maintained for him have been sought; and (B) stating the applicant's reasons for believing that the records sought are not relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this chapter in some other respect. (2) Service shall be made under this section upon a governmental entity by delivering or mailing by registered or certified mail a copy of the papers to the person, office, or department specified in the notice which the customer has received pursuant to this chapter. For the purposes of this section, the term "delivery" has the meaning given that term in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (3) If the court finds that the customer has complied with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the court shall order the governmental entity to file a sworn response, which may be filed in camera if the governmental entity includes in its response the reasons which make in camera review appropriate. If the court is unable to determine the motion or application on the basis of the parties' initial allegations and response, the court may conduct such additional proceedings as it deems appropriate. All such proceedings shall be completed and the motion or application decided as soon as practicable after the filing of the governmental entity's response. (4) If the court finds that the applicant is not the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are maintained, or that there is a reason to believe that the law enforcement inquiry is legitimate and that the communications sought are relevant to that inquiry, it shall deny the motion or application and order such process enforced. If the court finds that the applicant is the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are maintained, and that there is not a reason to believe that the communications sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry, or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this chapter, it shall order the process quashed. (5) A court order denying a motion or application under this section shall not be deemed a final order and no interlocutory appeal may be taken therefrom by the customer. (Added Pub.

(2) Any action against the United States under this section shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within 2 years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within 6 months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.

(d) Exclusive Remedy .—Any action against the United States under this subsection shall be the exclusive remedy against the United States for any claims within the purview of this section.

(2) In this subsection, the terms "related criminal case" and "related investigation" mean an actual prosecution or investigation in progress at the time at which the request for the stay or any subsequent motion to lift the stay is made.

(3) In requesting a stay under paragraph (1), the Government may, in appropriate cases, submit evidence ex parte in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect a related investigation or a related criminal case. If the Government makes such an ex parte submission, the plaintiff shall be given an opportunity to make a submission to the court, not ex parte, and the court may, in its discretion, request further information from either party.
